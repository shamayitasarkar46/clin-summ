My name is [NAME], I am 33 yearsold, from Romania in Europe and I have a 6 inches difference between my left humerus bone and my right one. It all started when I was around 4 yearsold and I had a bone illness called: bone cyst. First it affect my right femur and then my left shoulder. The bones were very fragile in the mentioned areas and I had fractured them many times very easily. I had 3 surgery at my shoulder and I heal up after a bone transplant from my hip and after some hidrocortisone injections. All good but as I said my left humerus bone is a lot shorter. The doctors said that my growth plate was affected that's way it is this difference between hands. It bother me a lot, especally when I m in sports (bodybuillding, basketball), I and I would like to know if there is something that can be done for me to make things right.
