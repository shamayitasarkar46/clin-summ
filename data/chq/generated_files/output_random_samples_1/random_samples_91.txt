MESSAGE: Hi, I am writing because I have been diagnosed with depression and have been treated with several different medications because of a serious side effect I get with sertraline.  They have given me a small dosage, 25mg a day,  I have tried with Celexa, Prestiq, Paxil, Cymbalta and they all make my legs shaky.  I get weak in my legs and I get a tingling sensation.  My legs hurt and get a tingling sensastion.    Why do I get this side effect?  Is there something else I can take??  I was also wondering if it has to do with any other medications that I take.  Sometimes I take dormicum for sleeping problems and Lorazepan.    Eagerly waiting for your comments", "target": "What antidepressants are not likely to interact with lorazepam and cause weakness and tingling in my legs?"}}
