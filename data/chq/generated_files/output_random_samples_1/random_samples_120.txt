I have done some of my own research and it looks like not much can be done for this condition. I do not have it all over my body it\u2019s only in my armpits. In the past I\u2019ve gone to doctors and dermatologist they gave me no answers until I looked online today and finally found out what I have. I don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m wrong. But this disease isn\u2019t even consider common because no one has done anything about it. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re thousands of women with it... Can I be tested for it and help in some kind of way to finding a cure or something?  What testing is done for this?  And where? Thank you", "target": "How can I get tested and treated for trimethylaminuria?"}}

Based on insurance I could only get 4 tablet for a 30 day supply. The pediatrician thought the remaining 3/4 of the tablet must be discarded once it was exposed to air, but the pharmacist had not heard this. I read through your literature on the drug and also did not see this warning. Can we use the remaining 3/4 of the tablet on additional weeks as long as it is kept at the correct storing specifications? Thank you for your time!", "target": "What are the storage requirements for Mefloquine HCL?"}}
