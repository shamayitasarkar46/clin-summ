He is end stage liver failure, but dosn't meet the guidelines for a liver transplant due to a colon cancer diagnosis in 2012.  The colon cancer was successfully treated with colon resection. We were told by a previous physician that there is an approved drug which ""cures"" hep b.  He emphasized that the new drug is a cure, not a treatment.  I tried to find infoon my own, to no avail.  I contacted NIH and was told to call the FDA.  I have had no response from the FDA re: messages left in 2013.  Their website was futile. Can you assist us.  My family member is end stage and if this physician was accurate, this could assist us tremendously.  He is taking baracluse and  xifacxin as well as lactulose.  His primary care physician is alarmingly unknowledgable."
