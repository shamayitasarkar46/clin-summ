query 1: SUBJECT: Ankle Injury MESSAGE: I got hurt in my left leg ankle almost 5 months ago. I went to doctor, got x-ray, where no damage was found. He suggested me some pain killers and advised me to wear anklet. I have been following the instruction since then; I went to another doctor who advised me to go for physiotherapy (Short Wave Diathermy) and advised me some exercises. I have been following them too. But yet now, I have not been fully recovered from the pain. Especially when I try to walk quickly or try to put pressure with my left leg, I feel pain. I am very tensed about this. Can you please suggest me how to overcome the pain. Thanks.

query 2: SUBJECT: Rehabbing a finger that was splinted MESSAGE: I badlydislocated my finger 7 weeks ago.  I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?

query 6: SUBJECT: Need help! MESSAGE: I have a knot about the size of a BB in my right forearm about 2-3 inches from my elbow. It's been there for about 5 years and hurts sometimes. Mostly only notice it when i put pressure on it. You can't see it but can feel it pretty good. It will move about a cm in any direction. I went to the doctors about 4 years ago to have it looked at but they did no xray and said its prob a BB from when i was younger. It's starting to hurt more now without me putting pressure on it so i'm thinking i need to have something done about it. Any ideas on what it could be or what i should do about it?
