query 4: Passing on a genetic condtion. My son is affected with an autosomal recessive genetic condition - Senior Loken Syndrome.  His brother is not affected.  1) What are the chances that my affected son's kids will have this disorder, and 2) how does my other son know if he is a carrier? Many thanks for responding.  I searched, but could not find an answer to this.  I did find this: Autosomal recessive inheritance: Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent (illustration). ~[NAME]
