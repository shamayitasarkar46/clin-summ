query 1: SUBJECT: severe vaginal bleeding MESSAGE: I've been bleeding for almost 9 long years. I've been to the doctor and he just put me on birth control saying it will balance itself out. That didn't work. We tried another birth control..it didn't work either. Ever since this problem started I've had terrible migraines, I gained weight (which I've tried to exercise and diet off), severe vaginal pain, cramping, heavy bleeding, blood clots the size of my hand. I've probably gone through 1000's of underwear and my life revolves around this issue. My sex life is one sided (which sucks) and I just want help..what should I do..I feel like I should have another doctor..

query 5: SUBJECT: nf 1 MESSAGE: Hi, my name is [NAME]. I have nf1 and have the benign tumors in my back and neck. I have also had problems with my health, and was wondering about one specific thing. I had to have a full hysterectomy done because of endometriosis and large cysts about 5 years ago. Now about 3 weeks ago I had to have emergency surgery because my bowels and colon were badly tangled and twisted due to scar tissue, I also had endometriosis on them to, plus more large cysts. So now I was hoping you could tell me if all that could be caused from the nf. I thank you very much for your time.

query 6: MESSAGE: Hi,I hope you can help me with my query, but if not, maybe you can point me in the right direction.I currently suffer from lower abdominal adhesions, that were diagnosed and separated in January 2013, but have since returned.To combat the pain, I have begun an application to get a neurostymulation device inserted into my lower back.However, the main reason why I am contacting you is for a second opinion on whether or not I will have difficulty or if I can pregnant. Would it be advisable to avoid pregnancy? Please know that we have always talked about adoption, so it is not the end of the world if I can't have my own kids.Also, I was told that my adhesions were caused by an appendectomy (appendix had not ruptured) I had in 2004, but as it was all keyhole surgery, I don't understand why? Please note that they also removed a small cist from both the ovaries and bowel at the the same time. I am prone to small ovarian cists that come and go on their own (most of the time).Can you help with my questions?Many Thanks for any information you have,Kind Regards,[NAME]

But yet now, I have not been fully recovered from the pain. Especially when I try to walk quickly or try to put pressure with my left leg, I feel pain. I am very tensed about this.

query 9: I had the bladder sling surgery and the incontinence was cured for 1 week and then the leaking began again.  The Dr wanted to prescribe a pill to stop the leaking but I waited until I went back  for my one month check up, all the while leaking just as bad as I did before the surgery.  When she examined me she said the bladder had slipped out of the sling and we would have to do the surgery again this time she would suture it to the ligament behind the pelvic bone.   My question is this:  #1. why would it slip?  was she supposed to suture it before to prevent the slipping? what guarantees that it won't slip again?  I am very concerned about having to go under anesthesia again and certainly do not want to risk having to go yet a 3rd time to solve my stress incontinence issues. Thank you for ever help you can give with these answers.
