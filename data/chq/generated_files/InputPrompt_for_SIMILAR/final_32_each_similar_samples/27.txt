query 8: SUBJECT: Rehabbing a finger that was splinted MESSAGE: I badlydislocated my finger 7 weeks ago.  I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?

query 26: Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things.

It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD.

query 33: I had a left knee replacement - osteo arthritis and related to a sport injury.  I was assaulted and the replacement was damaged. I had a second left knee replacement. About 6 months later the knee started swelling up. GP diagnosed it as gout, and treated it with gout medication. These flare ups happened more and more  frequently and increased in severity, especially after having a left hip replacement. GP twice treated with steriod (cortisone)injections. Before injecting the cortisone, the GP drained blood from the knee joint. Had relief but only for short period. GP then referred me to orthopeadic surgeon again. After X rays, ultra sound (which indicated that I had a bursar and baker’s cyst as well as extensive fluid on the knee), nuclear (bone and gallium) tests, nothing showed up. Surgeon surmises that the plastic disc that forms part of the prothesis, may be breaking up in microscopic particles He suggested that I go for another operation and get a hinge prothesis I looked at a photo in the brochure, and noticed that there is also a plastic disc My question is therefore - if the current plastic disc is disintegrating, isn’t the possibility that this will happen again? It seems as if the body rejects the plastic disc. At the moment I am using Codalgin Forte (500mg paracetamol and 30mg codeine) I am very reluctant to have the operation BUT also feel I can’t go on like this as these flare ups can happen any time and compromises my day to day living. During such a flare up I can’t walk, sometimes for a couple of days. I lie in bed with cold compresses on the knee! I will appreciate any advice.
