A year ago i got sick, Gorlin Goltz syndrome an mutation of the PCH1 Gen. My condition worsened and here in Germany, nobody can help me. Sry for my english, its not the best.

My doctors here in Germany partly dont know what to do and iam actually a strong person but I stay in an impasse. For me its no travel too far or too long. I fight for a long time but since I get every three weeks basaliomas I lose my zest for life. Im sure it gives an opportunity even if it is a larger intervention that I can be cured. Whatever how much it costs. I have read that they are furthest in the research which relates to cancer. I have a big heart, and no way is to long for me if you help me. PLEASE HELP ME!!!
