query 2: Passing on a genetic condtion. My son is affected with an autosomal recessive genetic condition - Senior Loken Syndrome.  His brother is not affected.  1) What are the chances that my affected son's kids will have this disorder, and 2) how does my other son know if he is a carrier? Many thanks for responding.  I searched, but could not find an answer to this.  I did find this: Autosomal recessive inheritance: Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent (illustration). ~[NAME]

query 3: "SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information MESSAGE: We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations, My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder (at Yale) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations. What would be the best way to proceed? Is there anyone out there looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other disorders that might be interested in our ""story""?"

query 8: SUBJECT: congenital diaphragmatic hernia MESSAGE: I need to know if CDH can be passed down to future generations.  I just learned that this condition most likely caused the death of my first child back in 1971.  I was then told it was merely a fluke.  I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health.  Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in [DATE] 2015.  Does the term 'congenital' mean that it could be passed down to another generation?  I do not want to alarm my son and his wife.  I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience.  Unfortunately my son and I are estranged.  And I do not know who is their pediatrician.  My child's CDH was very severe.  I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition.  Please respond to my concerns.
