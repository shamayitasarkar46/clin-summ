query 26: Many of us have a fear of getting an asymptomatic, insideous perforation in the digestive tract -- one that leads to vague complaints or even degenerative conditions but doesn't announce itself in any acute way.  Can this ever happen?  And if it does, how can a patient detect it?  There are stories of people swallowing needles and they don't even know it! One answer I've heard put forward is that foreign objects embedded in tissue become encased in some kind of hard flesh and somehow eliminated from the body.  Could this really happen?  Is there something I could read about it?  What about the people who have found foreign objects still sitting around in their tissues after aeons? I'm one of those internet worry-worts.  I go to online forums where people really want to know the worst case scenario for things like this.  This particular issue has worried me for years.  Thanks for discussing it with me. [NAME]
