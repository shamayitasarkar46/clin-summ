query 1: SUBJECT: Carbon Monoxide MESSAGE: Once you are exposed to Carbon Monoxide and the source of the leak is found and resolved (i.e., source is Furnace and shut off by the Gas Company), and the air is clear, is it still necessary to have the oxygen treatments and/or blood tests, or, do the levels in your body go back to normal afterwards.
