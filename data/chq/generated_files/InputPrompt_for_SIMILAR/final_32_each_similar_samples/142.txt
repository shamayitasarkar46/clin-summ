query 2: SUBJECT: congenital diaphragmatic hernia MESSAGE: I need to know if CDH can be passed down to future generations.  I just learned that this condition most likely caused the death of my first child back in 1971.  I was then told it was merely a fluke.  I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health.  Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in [DATE] 2015.  Does the term 'congenital' mean that it could be passed down to another generation?  I do not want to alarm my son and his wife.  I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience.  Unfortunately my son and I are estranged.  And I do not know who is their pediatrician.  My child's CDH was very severe.  I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition.  Please respond to my concerns.
