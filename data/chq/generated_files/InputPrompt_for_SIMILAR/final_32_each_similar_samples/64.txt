query 5: MESSAGE: Hi,I hope you can help me with my query, but if not, maybe you can point me in the right direction.I currently suffer from lower abdominal adhesions, that were diagnosed and separated in January 2013, but have since returned.To combat the pain, I have begun an application to get a neurostymulation device inserted into my lower back.However, the main reason why I am contacting you is for a second opinion on whether or not I will have difficulty or if I can pregnant. Would it be advisable to avoid pregnancy? Please know that we have always talked about adoption, so it is not the end of the world if I can't have my own kids.Also, I was told that my adhesions were caused by an appendectomy (appendix had not ruptured) I had in 2004, but as it was all keyhole surgery, I don't understand why? Please note that they also removed a small cist from both the ovaries and bowel at the the same time. I am prone to small ovarian cists that come and go on their own (most of the time).Can you help with my questions?Many Thanks for any information you have,Kind Regards,[NAME]
