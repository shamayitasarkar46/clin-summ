query 1: SUBJECT: Stroke Due to Aneurysm? MESSAGE: My son had a hemmorhagic stroke at 4 weeks of age....he is now 31 years old.  In the week leading up to the stroke he had a head cold and I had been giving  him infant cold drops.  After he had the stroke the doctors at the time could only say that it was a 'fluke' and would probably never happen again.  The reason for the stroke has haunted me ever since.  Now we just recently found out that my mother has a cerebral aneurysm and they say this can be hereditary.  So my question now is 'did my son have an aneurysm that burst or was it caused by a blood clot?...is there anyway of knowing or getting an answer to that question after the event has happened?

Can you please suggest me how to overcome the pain. Thanks.

query 3: SUBJECT: how to breathe MESSAGE: Dear Sirs,  This may seem like a stupid question but here goes anyway.  I am 64 yrs old and a type II diabetic.  I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance. I dont know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and dont's and if there is a 'better' way to breath.  Thanks very much for your help with this,  Regards,  [NAME]

query 32: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study MESSAGE: Are there any studies looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other related disorders? We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations (only 1 male in each), My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder as a child (at [LOCATION]) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc).
