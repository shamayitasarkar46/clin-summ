Hope you can advise one way or the other?MaleAge 62Good health, eat well and exercise regularly.I have muscle soreness in my legs I would associate with overuse. However, the soreness started approximately 6 weeks ago after over using quads/thighs while snow skiing and continues today. Takes a few minutes to get out of a chair or get out of bed but I continue to exercise as always; Pilaties, snow skiing, bike riding, long walks in hilly country, etc. Not debilitating but annoying. Stopped taking statins about a week ago but soreness continues. Unusual for me.Any thoughts?
