query 1: SUBJECT: Severly depressed/Major Anziety MESSAGE: I have been addicted to opiates and have been on suboxone for a few years now. I also take anxiety meds and an anti-seizure medication. Lately my life has been spinning out of control and I'm so scared. I can't seem to find the right doctor and I need someone to speak to NOT JUST GIVE ME MEDICATIONS! I need help and if I do not get help soon I'm afraid for myself. I have no intentions on hurting or harming myself but I'm a mess. I need a doctor who can help me in both ways (talking & medication). I just want to go away, move far away! What would you suggest? What type of doctor should I be looking for? I'm desperate!

query 2: SUBJECT: Setraline side effects. MESSAGE: Hi, I am writing because I have been diagnosed with depression and have been treated with several different medications because of a serious side effect I get with sertraline.  They have given me a small dosage, 25mg a day,  I have tried with Celexa, Prestiq, Paxil, Cymbalta and they all make my legs shaky.  I get weak in my legs and I get a tingling sensation.  My legs hurt and get a tingling sensastion.    Why do I get this side effect?  Is there something else I can take??  I was also wondering if it has to do with any other medications that I take.  Sometimes I take dormicum for sleeping problems and Lorazepan.    Eagerly waiting for your comments
