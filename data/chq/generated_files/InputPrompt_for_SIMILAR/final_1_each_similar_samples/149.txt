query 1: SUBJECT: phenobarbital MESSAGE: I have been taking this medication for many years.  I am 75 years old and would like to know if there is any other medication to replace  phenobabiral.  I am concerned that it could be toxic to me as I become older.  I also take Dilantin as I have a seizure disorder due to a birth defect.  Any info you could provide would be appreciated.

query 2: My father had hip surgery. About one month he was detected an infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. They started to give him intravenous ertanpenem. After almost a month, he is having episodes of seizures. He never had before. The doctors say that ertanpenem has nothing to do with it and they continue to provide it and at the same time they are giving him anti-seizure medication. I would like to know if it is correct or is at risk for his life. Thank you very much
