query 1: Tri-Gem Neuralgia.  I had an episode with the tri gem 2 days after i was rear-ended.  It was incredible pain that lasted 10 days. In the months following i had 2 decompression surgeries. the 1st one didnt work, was pain free for about 90 days.  The second syrgery 6 months later left me with a numb face but no tri gemn pain. Could the tri gem have been brought on from the trauma to the head from the car accident? I had been diagosed prior to  the accident, but was not experiencing any symptoms for a long time.  Then the accident and  1 1 /2 days later im in a full blown episode. Please let me know what your thoughts are.
