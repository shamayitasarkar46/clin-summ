query 1: Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?
summarized question 1: What are the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and when should I contact my doctor to discuss my symptoms?

query 2: Gadolinum toxicity and MCS relationship? I have 2 Genovia Labs test results years apart with seriously high Gadolinum toxicity. AND I am very VERY VERY very challenged by MCS - Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. My question is: If I had multiple MARs after an auto accident. And since then the MCS is debilitating. Certainly the symptoms of Gas level in my body cause symptoms as well. But I am debilitated by Synthetic chemicals in the air.  How can I find out if the Gas exhaserbated my reaction to exhaust fumes, air fresheners, perfumes, dryer sheets(!!!!), food additives, and much more. Many Thanks
