query 2: SUBJECT: Carbon Monoxide MESSAGE: Once you are exposed to Carbon Monoxide and the source of the leak is found and resolved (i.e., source is Furnace and shut off by the Gas Company), and the air is clear, is it still necessary to have the oxygen treatments and/or blood tests, or, do the levels in your body go back to normal afterwards.  I understand that there could be long term effects based on the term of the exposure, but, if you do not lose consciousness, are the treatments still necessary?  Should someone still have oxygen treatment, blood-work, CT scans, heart/lung scans if the problem has been resolved and air is clear?  It has been over 48 hours since the exposure.
