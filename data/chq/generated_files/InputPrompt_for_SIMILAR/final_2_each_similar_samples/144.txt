query 2: Passing on a genetic condtion. My son is affected with an autosomal recessive genetic condition - Senior Loken Syndrome.  His brother is not affected.  1) What are the chances that my affected son's kids will have this disorder, and 2) how does my other son know if he is a carrier? Many thanks for responding.  I searched, but could not find an answer to this.  I did find this: Autosomal recessive inheritance: Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent (illustration). ~[NAME]

query 3: My brother and I are twins. We both have XLCSNB and but I have 50% and my brother has 100%. We have an older brother with 15/20 in both eyes with no other complications. The disease came from our mom's side, and she has a sister and an aunt and uncle who also carried the gene. Our aunt has two kids who don't have the disease. If you could get back to me about latest research for XLCSNB that would be great.
