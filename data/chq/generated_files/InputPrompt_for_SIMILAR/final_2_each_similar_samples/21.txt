query 2: SUBJECT: Very high blood sugar! MESSAGE: I had two injections in my feet yesterday (5-22-14).  The physician said to watch my blood sugar carefully, as the injections could cause a rise in my blood count. I began having memory problems last evening after an MRI, and then this morning and at noon today (5-23-14), my count has been 427.  I have read my magazines about diabetes, pulled up several things on Medline Plus, and tried to get in touch with two of my doctors who might help.  Everyone is busy, and I totally understand.  I just need to know what, if anything, I can do to get my blood sugar down as fast as possible.  Thank you,  [NAME] [CONTACT]
