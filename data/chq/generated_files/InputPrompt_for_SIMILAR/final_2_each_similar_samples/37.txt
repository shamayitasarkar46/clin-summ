query 1: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study MESSAGE: I have had epilepsy for 26 years and my seizures have never been under control. I started the Modified Atkins Diet a couple of weeks ago, but I am having serious issues and hope you might have an answer. My seizures have tripled in these 2 weeks than what have been in years. Does this diet take a lot of time for this not to happen? or Does this diet not work for everyone? Please help me.

query 2: Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?
summarized question 2: What are the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and when should I contact my doctor to discuss my symptoms?

query 3: Hello. I have been a small eater my entire life, but always had difficulties eating. I’ve never looked at myself as having an eating disorder, but during the last year I came onto other thoughts when I went on a scale and saw a tiny bit of weight loss even when I felt I was eating more. That was earlier this year. For the last while I’ve had extremely difficulties eating. One meal a day is struggle enough. I want to gain weight and I want to eat. I’m a size 8, but sometimes even that is slightly big. I have never looked at myself as fat and always wanted to gain weight but never really had a desire to eat unless I’m super hungry or feel like I need to eat to avoid passing out. My stomach tells me to eat, but my brain informs me that I don’t need food and therefore I don’t eat. At my worst I feel nauseous just the tought of eating. I am super worried about this. Is there any vitamins or some sort of medication that can get me to eat even just a little bit more? Thanks.
