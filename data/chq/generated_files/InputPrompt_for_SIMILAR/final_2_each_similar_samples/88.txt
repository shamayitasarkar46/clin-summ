query 1: MESSAGE: I have been dealing with an autoimmune disease for almost 4 years now, I've been tested for many things and the doctors can't seem to find what excactly is wrong. It began with pain, swelling and stiffness in my feet and  toes.A lot of the pain is joint stiff n ess and my skin feels like its being burned. Over time it has moved into my knees also. I am always tired. Recently I've been getting pains in my stomache and feeling sick. Does any of this sound like Lupus?? I've tested negative for it before, but the more I read about it I feel that's what i could have. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

query 2: Tri-Gem Neuralgia.  I had an episode with the tri gem 2 days after i was rear-ended.  It was incredible pain that lasted 10 days. In the months following i had 2 decompression surgeries. the 1st one didnt work, was pain free for about 90 days.  The second syrgery 6 months later left me with a numb face but no tri gemn pain. Could the tri gem have been brought on from the trauma to the head from the car accident? I had been diagosed prior to  the accident, but was not experiencing any symptoms for a long time.  Then the accident and  1 1 /2 days later im in a full blown episode. Please let me know what your thoughts are.
