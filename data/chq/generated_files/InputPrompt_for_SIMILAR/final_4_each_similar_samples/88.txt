It began with pain, swelling and stiffness in my feet and  toes.A lot of the pain is joint stiff n ess and my skin feels like its being burned. Over time it has moved into my knees also. I am always tired. Recently I've been getting pains in my stomache and feeling sick. Does any of this sound like Lupus?? I've tested negative for it before, but the more I read about it I feel that's what i could have. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.

query 2: Tri-Gem Neuralgia.  I had an episode with the tri gem 2 days after i was rear-ended.  It was incredible pain that lasted 10 days. In the months following i had 2 decompression surgeries. the 1st one didnt work, was pain free for about 90 days.  The second syrgery 6 months later left me with a numb face but no tri gemn pain. Could the tri gem have been brought on from the trauma to the head from the car accident? I had been diagosed prior to  the accident, but was not experiencing any symptoms for a long time.  Then the accident and  1 1 /2 days later im in a full blown episode. Please let me know what your thoughts are.

query 3: SUBJECT: Please help me MESSAGE: I have been dealing with undiagnosed issues. It started 3 years ago as nausea and dull achy pain. Doctors decided to remove my gallbladder, even though it only had scarring. Since the surgery ([DATE]) I have had a sharp, stabbing random pain in that area and around it. I also get dull, crampy pain. Finally, the surgeon ordered a CT scan because the pain is so bad. His nurse called and said everything was fine. So I went to my primary, who noticed that I have ascites on my liver. My side is slightly bloated, was not before. And I am scared because I don't know what I'm supposed to do. No one will help me and I do not want to be on pain meds my whole life.  Please let me know your thoughts or guide me in the direction I need, please.  I live in south carolina, i dont know why when I made my email it had the co.uk
