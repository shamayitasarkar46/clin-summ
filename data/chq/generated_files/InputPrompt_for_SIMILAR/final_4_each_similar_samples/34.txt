query 1: "My sister was diagnosed with meningitis 13 years ago and lost her sight. She's had multiple doctors tell her that she's lying about not being able to see or that they do not see why she can't see given that her eyes reacts to light. Fast forward 13 years, I spoke with her today and she was a little overjoyed. She said that ""she's been having good days"". I asked her to elaborate and she said that sometimes she can see shadows and sometimes she can see light. From my self-knowledge, I thought that this kind of vision loss could not be repaired. I'm writing you all for possible answers or if you could point me in the right direction toward getting them. Thanks in advance."

query 4: SUBJECT: Bendectin MESSAGE: In 1964, I began taking Bendectin for morning sickness and with each subsequent pregnancy I continued to do so. My third child developed a meningioma of the brain at 11 years old and currently, my daughter, 47 years old, has been diagnosed with a lesion(?) of the brain. I am justifiably concerned about my daughter's condition and wonder if I contributed to her status. I am only interested in helping her and not for any litigious reason. If someone also had a similar situation and was treated positively, I would so appreciate knowing about it. Thank you and God bless.
