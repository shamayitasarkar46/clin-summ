query 2: "SUBJECT: Decreasing Wellbutrin HCL XL MESSAGE: Hello, I'm not sure if this is something you can help me with, but I thought that I would ask, as your organization is affiliated with trusted mental health and general health organizations.  I was recently taken off of Wellbutrin HCL XL completely without any tapering. I'm having a difficult time finding out online if this is safe (to ""go cold turkey"") or if I should have been given the medication in slowly-decreasing doses. Can you please offer some guidance?  Thank you. [NAME]"

query 4: MESSAGE: Will storing my medication in the freezer reduce their efficacy? I have many and more related questions about storing pills at various temperatures that I would like to ask about, but let's start with that question. The drugs that I am concerned about are digoxin and lisinopril. As far as I know, the dosage is the lowest possible prescribed dosage for each medication (if that matters). I hope my question will not be thought of as a specific, or individually based question and you are able to answer in the most broad and objective way. Thank you very much in advance.
