query 1: SUBJECT: Customer Service Request MESSAGE: Hi, We are 2 sisters and a brother. My brother at age of 24 is detected with catract, however it is mild so operation is not required. But doctor said, there are chances he has this from Birth. However only from past 1.5years he had a little blur vision. And in my entire family Mom and Dad said no one has had catract from Birth. We are a big family, my grapa had 7 brothers and 2 sisters no one from their family or my mom has catract from birth or even at early age. My concern is, if i am pregnant will my children have any issue like this. I amd my sister, mom, dad we all have got our eyes checked. we dont have any issue. I am really tensed as i am expecting. Can you please help me with the answer.

query 2: Passing on a genetic condtion. My son is affected with an autosomal recessive genetic condition - Senior Loken Syndrome.  His brother is not affected.  1) What are the chances that my affected son's kids will have this disorder, and 2) how does my other son know if he is a carrier? Many thanks for responding.  I searched, but could not find an answer to this.  I did find this: Autosomal recessive inheritance: Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent (illustration). ~[NAME]
summarized question 2: What are the inheritance patterns for senior loken syndrome?

query 3: "SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information MESSAGE: We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations, My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder (at Yale) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations. What would be the best way to proceed? Is there anyone out there looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other disorders that might be interested in our ""story""?"
summarized question 3: Are there any researchers interested in testing a family with ADD and low IQ for fragile X?

query 4: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study MESSAGE: Are there any studies looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other related disorders? We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations (only 1 male in each), My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder as a child (at [LOCATION]) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and very similar intellectual deficits.

summarized question 4: Where can I find information on Fragile X sydrome and inheritance patterns?

query 5: My brother and I are twins. We both have XLCSNB and but I have 50% and my brother has 100%. We have an older brother with 15/20 in both eyes with no other complications. The disease came from our mom's side, and she has a sister and an aunt and uncle who also carried the gene. Our aunt has two kids who don't have the disease. If you could get back to me about latest research for XLCSNB that would be great.
