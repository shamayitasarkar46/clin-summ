query 1: Tri-Gem Neuralgia.  I had an episode with the tri gem 2 days after i was rear-ended.  It was incredible pain that lasted 10 days. In the months following i had 2 decompression surgeries. the 1st one didnt work, was pain free for about 90 days.  The second syrgery 6 months later left me with a numb face but no tri gemn pain. Could the tri gem have been brought on from the trauma to the head from the car accident? I had been diagosed prior to  the accident, but was not experiencing any symptoms for a long time.  Then the accident and  1 1 /2 days later im in a full blown episode. Please let me know what your thoughts are.
summarized question 1: Can symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia be exacerbated by head trauma?

query 2: SUBJECT: concussions and long term head trauma  from abuse Ii MESSAGE: I was a victim from an abusive relationship, both verbal and physical. During this time I received substantial injuries to my head. Slight concussions led to full-fledged concussions, losing the ability to talk very well, then think very well, and a subdural hematoma, on the left side, bled down inside my head to behind my left eye, which made it unable to move. Along with an intense headache and drinking a lot of coffee, the neurosurgeon didn't have to do brain surgery,  as my eye finally moved!Battered Women's told me to get out of the area a stay gone if I wanted to stay alive. So I did! Speech Therapy helped considerably, the story goes on.  Anyway, I hear and read a lot about concussions and head trauma for football players,  young and old,  and wonder if any studies have ever been done for women?   A few years ago,  I had a partial stroke,  but enough to set me back a bit.  But this time I know what I need to do to help fix my head,  again.
summarized question 2: What is the latest research on concussions and head trauma in women?

query 3: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study. Do you have any more indepth information regarding pseudocholinesterace deficiency? My son 28 and myself 56 have this problem and we both have systemic muscle spasms. cramps contractions. Most seem to be caused by knots or trigger points. I assume this has something to do with this deficiency because it deals with neuro transmissions correct. Anyway we are looking for relief. The muscle relaxants help a bit but the knots do not go away and so the pain is still there at a deeper level. The doctors and neurologist have no idea. Thank you. [NAME]
