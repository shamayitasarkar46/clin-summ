query 4: Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?

query 6: SUBJECT: Insomnia (special case) MESSAGE: Hi, Im 40 years old male. I was suffering from social anxiety since I was child.  Last year, I decided to go to a psychologist. She advised me to practice meditation, mindfulness and CBT as well.  She explained to me the great positive impact of the meditation, mindfulness on the brain activity (neuroplasticity). Since then, I've been practicing these techniques. The result was awesome. I no longer suffer from my social anxiety and my life has completely changed to the positive side. No more worry, stress, anxiety, etc.  But at the same time, I started to suffer from chronic insomnia until now. Of course, Im always in touch with my psychiatrist who has prescribed me the necessary and still following me up. Even tough, my insomnia doesn't improved.  Unfortunately, nobody can determine the real cause of my insomnia.  If I know the cause, I'll do my best to find the key to resolve this problem.  According to my mentioned story, can you help me to find the real cause of my insomnia?   Thank you, Your answer is very appreciable and important to me.   [NAME].
