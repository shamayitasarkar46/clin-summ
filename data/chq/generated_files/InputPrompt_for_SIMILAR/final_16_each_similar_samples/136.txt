query 2: SUBJECT: other uses for Phentermine MESSAGE: Hello, My name is [NAME]. I do not usually send comments or questions online. I am only doing this because I am trying to find an answer to a baffling situation I am experiencing. I started taking Phentermine about 3 years ago for weight loss. I lost weight successfully, but also found that the Phentermine substantially relieved my arthritis pain. Now my doctor has taken me off of the Phentermine. He will not prescribe it for pain relief as he does not believe there is any correlation between the Phentermine and relief of my arthritis pain. I have taken many pain relief medications over the years as my arthritis is acute. The Phentermine works the best. Is there any correlation between Phentermine and pain relief?  Sincerely, [NAME]

query 3: SUBJECT: Rehabbing a finger that was splinted MESSAGE: I badlydislocated my finger 7 weeks ago.  I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?
summarized question 3: What are the treatments and prognosis for a dislocated finger not initially treated?

query 4: "SUBJECT: Decreasing Wellbutrin HCL XL MESSAGE: Hello, I'm not sure if this is something you can help me with, but I thought that I would ask, as your organization is affiliated with trusted mental health and general health organizations.  I was recently taken off of Wellbutrin HCL XL completely without any tapering.

Thank you. [NAME]"

query 5: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study MESSAGE: My name is [NAME] and I am 76 years old. I have had jock itch (just itch no rash) for 7 years. When I try to stop the itch comes back with a vengeance. I am currently using Ketoconazole 2% cream to control the itch. It appears that I am doomed to no cure but I hope I may be wrong. So, given this I have a few questions: 1. Am I still doomed or is/are there any drugs or treatments that can cure me? 2. If not, then are there any drugs that your studies have shown to be superior to Ketoconazole?  If so, will you please list up to 3 of them for me? 3. My Dermatologist suggested that I use Zeasorb antifungal powder.  Have you ever conducted a study of this? If so, how does it perform when compared to Ketoconazole or any of the drugs you may have listed in # 2 above?

Hope you can advise one way or the other?MaleAge 62Good health, eat well and exercise regularly.I have muscle soreness in my legs I would associate with overuse.

Takes a few minutes to get out of a chair or get out of bed but I continue to exercise as always; Pilaties, snow skiing, bike riding, long walks in hilly country, etc. Not debilitating but annoying. Stopped taking statins about a week ago but soreness continues. Unusual for me.Any thoughts?
