query 6: SUBJECT: severe vaginal bleeding MESSAGE: I've been bleeding for almost 9 long years. I've been to the doctor and he just put me on birth control saying it will balance itself out. That didn't work. We tried another birth control..it didn't work either. Ever since this problem started I've had terrible migraines, I gained weight (which I've tried to exercise and diet off), severe vaginal pain, cramping, heavy bleeding, blood clots the size of my hand. I've probably gone through 1000's of underwear and my life revolves around this issue. My sex life is one sided (which sucks) and I just want help..what should I do..I feel like I should have another doctor..

query 7: Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?
