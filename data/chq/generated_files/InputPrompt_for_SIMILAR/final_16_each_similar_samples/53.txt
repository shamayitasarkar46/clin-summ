query 1: Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?

query 10: MESSAGE: Will storing my medication in the freezer reduce their efficacy? I have many and more related questions about storing pills at various temperatures that I would like to ask about, but let's start with that question. The drugs that I am concerned about are digoxin and lisinopril. As far as I know, the dosage is the lowest possible prescribed dosage for each medication (if that matters). I hope my question will not be thought of as a specific, or individually based question and you are able to answer in the most broad and objective way. Thank you very much in advance.
