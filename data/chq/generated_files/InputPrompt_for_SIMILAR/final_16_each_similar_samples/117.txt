When I try to stop the itch comes back with a vengeance. I am currently using Ketoconazole 2% cream to control the itch. It appears that I am doomed to no cure but I hope I may be wrong.

If not, then are there any drugs that your studies have shown to be superior to Ketoconazole?  If so, will you please list up to 3 of them for me? 3. My Dermatologist suggested that I use Zeasorb antifungal powder.  Have you ever conducted a study of this? If so, how does it perform when compared to Ketoconazole or any of the drugs you may have listed in # 2 above?
