query 1: Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?

query 7: "My sister was diagnosed with meningitis 13 years ago and lost her sight. She's had multiple doctors tell her that she's lying about not being able to see or that they do not see why she can't see given that her eyes reacts to light. Fast forward 13 years, I spoke with her today and she was a little overjoyed. She said that ""she's been having good days"". I asked her to elaborate and she said that sometimes she can see shadows and sometimes she can see light. From my self-knowledge, I thought that this kind of vision loss could not be repaired. I'm writing you all for possible answers or if you could point me in the right direction toward getting them. Thanks in advance."
