I assume this has something to do with this deficiency because it deals with neuro transmissions correct. Anyway we are looking for relief. The muscle relaxants help a bit but the knots do not go away and so the pain is still there at a deeper level. The doctors and neurologist have no idea. Thank you. [NAME]
