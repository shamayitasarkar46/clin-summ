query 1: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information MESSAGE: Dear Team, In 1996, I had an accident on my left eye when a ball smashed it. Retina fallen down, lens damaged. I hadn't been operated at that point only later, in 2003 when the pressure was very high (above 30 mp). This first operation had fixed the retina with endolaser, removed vitreous body filled with silicone oil, replaced the lens with an artificial one and stabilized the pressure to around 15-10 mp. However, the eye got blood, retina got detached and it had to be operated again. This time, the oil replaced with gas. After 2 years, another attempt made with oil and lastly with gas, but the retina fallen again and again. Currently, the retina is still detached, the pressure is low (max 4 mp), has often blood around the iris and it hurts a bit when the air pressure changes. I cannot see anything with it apart from blur lights. The doctor says, this damaged eye is shrinking continuously. My other eye functioning well. I learned to live together with it, however, the doctor says, he strongly recommends enucleation. I dont know if there is any other option to avoid enucleation. I have 2 young children so if there were any option to avoid enucleatio, I would happy travel/pay for that. Kindly let me know if there is any other option. My main priority -if available- would be to live with my own or another organic eye which doesn't look scary even if it is not functional. Second priority is to have usable organic eye- but my doctor told, this is not yet possible. Please confirm. I know you are specialized in Thank you in advance -- Best regards, [CONTACT] [NAME]

query 8: "My sister was diagnosed with meningitis 13 years ago and lost her sight. She's had multiple doctors tell her that she's lying about not being able to see or that they do not see why she can't see given that her eyes reacts to light. Fast forward 13 years, I spoke with her today and she was a little overjoyed. She said that ""she's been having good days"". I asked her to elaborate and she said that sometimes she can see shadows and sometimes she can see light. From my self-knowledge, I thought that this kind of vision loss could not be repaired. I'm writing you all for possible answers or if you could point me in the right direction toward getting them. Thanks in advance."

query 9: I am trying to get some information.  I had eye surgery.  My surgical tech was clearly sick.  My hubby and i overheard her say she could not go home because they had no one to cover her.  When I was in the room alone with her and she was preparing for my surgery I clearly saw her clearing her throat coughing and touching her face covering her cough with the back of her hand.. I questioned her about the safety of her being there with a cold.. said dont worry thats why I have the mask on.. I put my trust in her went along with it.. 2 days later my nose was running profusely.. I called doctors office and they said dont worry its happens..that was a friday.. On monday I called the office and asked to be seen because my eye had started to swell..  it turns out i had developed an abscess  (endophtlamitis) now i am blind..  My understanding from reading your website the room was not sterile (air circulation) and the masks are not 100 percent germ proof..she was standing close to me handing the doctor tools i feel i was not safe with her coughing and touching them...I am looking for answers...thanks for all your help
