My doctor is at a loss for knowing how to treat me and the referrals I’ve received and numerous calls I’ve made are always dead ends here in the Houston Tx area. Can you please help me? I would like some information as to how to best be completely rid of this parasite infection. I will greatly appreciate your assistance and or a solid referral to someone who is treating patients for parasites. I have good pics and hopefully someone can identify the exact tapeworm I’m infected with and explain protocols for ridding them from all parts of my body.
