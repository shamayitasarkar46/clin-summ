query 7: SUBJECT: Rehabbing a finger that was splinted MESSAGE: I badlydislocated my finger 7 weeks ago.  I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?

query 9: Few years ago (like 3yrs) my uncle faced a massive accident. His back-bone broken, right leg anklet broken. He treated his backbone from Trauma Centre. Some steel plates and screws added with his backbone and his backbone is now completely ok. The problem is now with his both leg. From knee to leg finger-end is now completely senseless. He canâ€™t feel anything like touching or byte of any mosquitoes or any insects. Both legs are now thinned too much from thigh starting point to the leg end. He did some Physio-Therapy excercise but no improvement. Dr. said that nerve has teared in some place of leg. Now I want to know is there any therapy/treatment available to get rid of this kind of injury? How it can be cured and where is the treatment available? What kind of treatment is need to get cure?
