query 7: Passing on a genetic condtion. My son is affected with an autosomal recessive genetic condition - Senior Loken Syndrome.  His brother is not affected.  1) What are the chances that my affected son's kids will have this disorder, and 2) how does my other son know if he is a carrier? Many thanks for responding.  I searched, but could not find an answer to this.  I did find this: Autosomal recessive inheritance: Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent (illustration). ~[NAME]

query 10: SUBJECT: Whole-exome sequencing points to considerable genetic heterogeneity of cerebral palsy. MESSAGE: Hello, I am enquireing about Whole-exome sequencing points to considerable genetic heterogeneity of cerebral palsy. I would like to know if it is possible to find out if my daughter has cp through genetics or through medical negligence. Pls could you email me let me know if she could have whole-exome seguencing to get an indication. Here in the uk, Whole-exome sequencing testing is only done for projects etc . Please help ! Kind Regards

query 11: SUBJECT: human chimerism MESSAGE: My daughter, born 5 days ago, was curiously found to have c+ blood type.  Having ruled out most causes for this, we are left with a possible vanishing twin chimera and don't know where to turn for more information or research. At this point we don't even have confirmation of whether she is xx/xx or xx/xy, or concrete exclusion of microchimerism. Help?

query 12: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study MESSAGE: Are there any studies looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other related disorders? We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations (only 1 male in each), My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder as a child (at [LOCATION]) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and very similar intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations. What would be the best way to proceed?
