Ever since this problem started I've had terrible migraines, I gained weight (which I've tried to exercise and diet off), severe vaginal pain, cramping, heavy bleeding, blood clots the size of my hand. I've probably gone through 1000's of underwear and my life revolves around this issue. My sex life is one sided (which sucks) and I just want help..what should I do..I feel like I should have another doctor..
