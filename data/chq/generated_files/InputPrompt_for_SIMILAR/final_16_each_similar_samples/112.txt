query 7: I understand that you cannot provide opinions,nor suggest, any type of therpy.  My son (dob-[DATE]), was called back to the hospital four days after birth due to a abnormal PKU, which suggested adrenal hyperplasia. After test the endocrine physians felt he did not have the condition. Several years later he began having severe headaches preceded by violent vomiting epidodes  that lasted for hours. When he was admitted to [LOCATION],  he was suffering from bleeding esphogal ulcers,  and severe dehydration and, malnutrician. His urine (24 hr), blood plasma,& VMA,showed increased values of catacholomines.He also demostrated intermittent hypertension, and tachcardia through out the day (he had been diagnoised with ADHD several years earlier). His MIGB clearly showed bifocal uptake in both adrenal glands. The mri did not show tumors at that time ([DATE]. He has since been diagnoised with antral polys (biosphy's taken were misplaced, and the gastrologist would not redo the test), aberrant right subclavian artery,  esphogas pushed to the side, low oxygen intake, high levels of gastrin, cyclic vomiting syndrome, severe sinus attacks that come and go, without infection present.  His symptons that I have not already include heat intolerence, pallor, poor appetite with little weight gain, anxiety, tremor of hands, and stomach pain. After his mri, which I was told would take about 45mins, took over 5 hrs. Since then we have been having no luck with finding doctors that will take my son as a patient. Are you able to suggest a hospital that is knowlegable with pheochromocytomas? My son's father is mia, but during our 7 yrs together,  he also suffered severe headaches, and intermittent hypertension. He never followed up with a physian. Any help would be appreciated. I do not know what to do, and I do not want my son to end up a statistic.  Last night his BB was 180/115, with HR-50, half hour later his BP was 68/44 with HR of 122. I fear he is going to go in shoc

query 9: Good morning.  I have a question for a urologist or a surgeon.  This may be out there but I am not one to go with the flow.  Now I do not have prostate cancer but I like being ready for anything.  I will be having a blood test next week and then I will be seeing my doctor.  My PSA was up from the last few.  2015 - 0.4   2016 - 0.7 and 2017 - 2.2.  Now here is my question.   If I get prostate cancer and lets say that the tumor is in the right lobe can I just have the right lobe removed.  Nothing else.  Maybe the lymph node on that side but I do not want anything else removed  I do not want the bladder neck touch or the seminal vesicles or the other side of the prostate.  I know you must think this is crazy but I feel my sex life and my ejaculation is just as important to save as getting rid of the cancer.  I have been reading to many articles that say they take every because you may get cancer there.  So you are going to take out good tissue just because you may get it again.  I don't believe in that.  My urologist call me his challenge.  I do not give up total control.  Thank you for your time.  I hope you have a great day.
