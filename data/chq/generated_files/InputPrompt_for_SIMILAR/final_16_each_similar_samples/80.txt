query 2: Thank you for your response to my inquiry about the MMR vaccine.  I was born in 1942, never had the 10-day measles but did have the 3-day measles, and did have mumps as a child.  A recent blood test indicated that I am not immune to Rubella so my doctor recommended I get the MMR vaccine.  In light of my age, etc., do you agree or do you feel it is unnecessary or is there a separate vaccine for just Rubella?  Which is the measles that has started to reappear?

query 3: SUBJECT: CPTII Deficiency MESSAGE: My sister in Texas was just diagnosed with CPTII deficiency today.  We do not yet know which variant.  I was told a year ago following her near death from rhabdo (CK's 150,000+), ATN, RF, respiratory compromise, to be tested for a FA metabolic error.  Until today, I really had no idea which test to request.  Her muscle bx was performed a few months ago as she was still ill last year.  Another recurrence of rhado this year prompted the bx (she is retired military).  I don't know which branch of medicine to contact for genetic testing. From  the NIH website, muscle bx is the most definitive.  I also found a phone number for the Genetics and Rare Diseases Information Center.  Thank you for some direction.

query 8: SUBJECT: Bendectin MESSAGE: In 1964, I began taking Bendectin for morning sickness and with each subsequent pregnancy I continued to do so. My third child developed a meningioma of the brain at 11 years old and currently, my daughter, 47 years old, has been diagnosed with a lesion(?) of the brain. I am justifiably concerned about my daughter's condition and wonder if I contributed to her status. I am only interested in helping her and not for any litigious reason. If someone also had a similar situation and was treated positively, I would so appreciate knowing about it. Thank you and God bless.
