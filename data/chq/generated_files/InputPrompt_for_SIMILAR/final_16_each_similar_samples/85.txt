query 3: "cure for hepatitus B.  I am the care taker of a family member with hep B.  He is end stage liver failure, but dosn't meet the guidelines for a liver transplant due to a colon cancer diagnosis in 2012.  The colon cancer was successfully treated with colon resection. We were told by a previous physician that there is an approved drug which ""cures"" hep b.  He emphasized that the new drug is a cure, not a treatment.  I tried to find infoon my own, to no avail.  I contacted NIH and was told to call the FDA.  I have had no response from the FDA re: messages left in 2013.  Their website was futile. Can you assist us.  My family member is end stage and if this physician was accurate, this could assist us tremendously.  He is taking baracluse and  xifacxin as well as lactulose.  His primary care physician is alarmingly unknowledgable."

query 10: SUBJECT: congenital diaphragmatic hernia MESSAGE: I need to know if CDH can be passed down to future generations.  I just learned that this condition most likely caused the death of my first child back in 1971.  I was then told it was merely a fluke.  I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health.  Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in [DATE] 2015.  Does the term 'congenital' mean that it could be passed down to another generation?  I do not want to alarm my son and his wife.  I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience.  Unfortunately my son and I are estranged.  And I do not know who is their pediatrician.  My child's CDH was very severe.  I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition.  Please respond to my concerns.
