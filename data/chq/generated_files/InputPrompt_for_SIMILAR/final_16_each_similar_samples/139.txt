I am adopted and the records are still sealed and I have a son and a daughter and four grandchildren that could have had this deficiency passed on to them so you see why this is important to me. I got injured at work years ago and they gave me some kind of anesthesia I should not of had to find a bleeder on the inside and sew it and then they could not wake me up for two days. Also same job required that I get yellow fever shot every six months. No wonder I felt so awfull back then. I do not want or need a repeat of this or worse for my family or myself again. Please how to do this as I only get $9.00 an hour. I am a [PROFESSION] female. How many more blood tests do I need to substantiate this?
