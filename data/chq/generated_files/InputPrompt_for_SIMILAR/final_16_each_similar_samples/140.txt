I searched, but could not find an answer to this.  I did find this: Autosomal recessive inheritance: Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent (illustration). ~[NAME]

query 12: I understand that you cannot provide opinions,nor suggest, any type of therpy.  My son (dob-[DATE]), was called back to the hospital four days after birth due to a abnormal PKU, which suggested adrenal hyperplasia. After test the endocrine physians felt he did not have the condition. Several years later he began having severe headaches preceded by violent vomiting epidodes  that lasted for hours. When he was admitted to [LOCATION],  he was suffering from bleeding esphogal ulcers,  and severe dehydration and, malnutrician. His urine (24 hr), blood plasma,& VMA,showed increased values of catacholomines.He also demostrated intermittent hypertension, and tachcardia through out the day (he had been diagnoised with ADHD several years earlier). His MIGB clearly showed bifocal uptake in both adrenal glands. The mri did not show tumors at that time ([DATE]. He has since been diagnoised with antral polys (biosphy's taken were misplaced, and the gastrologist would not redo the test), aberrant right subclavian artery,  esphogas pushed to the side, low oxygen intake, high levels of gastrin, cyclic vomiting syndrome, severe sinus attacks that come and go, without infection present.  His symptons that I have not already include heat intolerence, pallor, poor appetite with little weight gain, anxiety, tremor of hands, and stomach pain. After his mri, which I was told would take about 45mins, took over 5 hrs. Since then we have been having no luck with finding doctors that will take my son as a patient. Are you able to suggest a hospital that is knowlegable with pheochromocytomas? My son's father is mia, but during our 7 yrs together,  he also suffered severe headaches, and intermittent hypertension. He never followed up with a physian. Any help would be appreciated. I do not know what to do, and I do not want my son to end up a statistic.  Last night his BB was 180/115, with HR-50, half hour later his BP was 68/44 with HR of 122. I fear he is going to go in shoc

query 15: MESSAGE: Hi,I hope you can help me with my query, but if not, maybe you can point me in the right direction.I currently suffer from lower abdominal adhesions, that were diagnosed and separated in January 2013, but have since returned.To combat the pain, I have begun an application to get a neurostymulation device inserted into my lower back.However, the main reason why I am contacting you is for a second opinion on whether or not I will have difficulty or if I can pregnant. Would it be advisable to avoid pregnancy? Please know that we have always talked about adoption, so it is not the end of the world if I can't have my own kids.Also, I was told that my adhesions were caused by an appendectomy (appendix had not ruptured) I had in 2004, but as it was all keyhole surgery, I don't understand why? Please note that they also removed a small cist from both the ovaries and bowel at the the same time. I am prone to small ovarian cists that come and go on their own (most of the time).Can you help with my questions?Many Thanks for any information you have,Kind Regards,[NAME]
