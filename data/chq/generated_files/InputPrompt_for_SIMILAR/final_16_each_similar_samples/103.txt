query 5: SUBJECT: Stroke Due to Aneurysm? MESSAGE: My son had a hemmorhagic stroke at 4 weeks of age....he is now 31 years old.  In the week leading up to the stroke he had a head cold and I had been giving  him infant cold drops.  After he had the stroke the doctors at the time could only say that it was a 'fluke' and would probably never happen again.  The reason for the stroke has haunted me ever since.  Now we just recently found out that my mother has a cerebral aneurysm and they say this can be hereditary.  So my question now is 'did my son have an aneurysm that burst or was it caused by a blood clot?...is there anyway of knowing or getting an answer to that question after the event has happened?

query 7: SUBJECT: affects from being molested MESSAGE: I was molested by my father when I was a child (over 45 years ago).  I've been working on recovery the past couple of years (the memories surfaced in 2010).  As part of my recovery, I'm exploring how being sodomized by my father may have damaged my rectum and surrounding areas.    What kinds of physical damage would have been done by a 22 year old male sodomizing a 5 year old boy?    I'm looking to see if that caused tears in the rectum that would have lead to having to have 9 surgeries as an adult to repair them.  I don't think they just happened.  thanks in advance.

query 10: "SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information MESSAGE: We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations, My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder (at Yale) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations. What would be the best way to proceed? Is there anyone out there looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other disorders that might be interested in our ""story""?"

query 12: SUBJECT: congenital diaphragmatic hernia MESSAGE: I need to know if CDH can be passed down to future generations.  I just learned that this condition most likely caused the death of my first child back in 1971.  I was then told it was merely a fluke.  I had NO trauma during the full-term pregnancy, and I and my then husband were in very good health.  Now my son (from a different husband) and his wife are due to have fraternal twins in [DATE] 2015.  Does the term 'congenital' mean that it could be passed down to another generation?  I do not want to alarm my son and his wife.  I just would like to inform whatever pediatrician is caring for these babies as to my experience.  Unfortunately my son and I are estranged.  And I do not know who is their pediatrician.  My child's CDH was very severe.  I know there are far less severe cases that can go undetected &/or undiagnosed unless there is a reason to suspect such a condition.  Please respond to my concerns.

query 17: It is unfortunate to say that my father was affected by AML M1 and  we got  to know a month ago and his age is 52. Initially he  had a blast cells percentage of 76% and later after the first cycle blast cells dropped down to 4%. After two weeks of rest, he had undergone first consolidation out of three with High intensity Ara-C and today he was discharged after one week of treatment. My father's doctor said that there will be two more cycles with a gap of 28 days in between. As chemotherapy has side effects I would like to go for ayurvedic treatment as well in order to support my father's condition. I'm unable to understand whether to take further step and go for ayurveda as I'm not aware of any proved cases. Please suggest me whether to go for ayurveda and are there any such cases recorded to keep  the disease in complete remission.
