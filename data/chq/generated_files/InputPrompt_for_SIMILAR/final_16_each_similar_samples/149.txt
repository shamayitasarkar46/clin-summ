query 15: Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?
