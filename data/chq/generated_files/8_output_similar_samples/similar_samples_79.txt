Last year, I decided to go to a psychologist. She advised me to practice meditation, mindfulness and CBT as well.  She explained to me the great positive impact of the meditation, mindfulness on the brain activity (neuroplasticity). Since then, I've been practicing these techniques. The result was awesome. I no longer suffer from my social anxiety and my life has completely changed to the positive side. No more worry, stress, anxiety, etc.  But at the same time, I started to suffer from chronic insomnia until now. Of course, Im always in touch with my psychiatrist who has prescribed me the necessary and still following me up. Even tough, my insomnia doesn't improved.  Unfortunately, nobody can determine the real cause of my insomnia.  If I know the cause, I'll do my best to find the key to resolve this problem.  According to my mentioned story, can you help me to find the real cause of my insomnia?   Thank you, Your answer is very appreciable and important to me.
