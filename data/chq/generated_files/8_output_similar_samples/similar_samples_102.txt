My doctor is at a loss for knowing how to treat me and the referrals I\u2019ve received and numerous calls I\u2019ve made are always dead ends here in the Houston Tx area. Can you please help me? I would like some information as to how to best be completely rid of this parasite infection. I will greatly appreciate your assistance and or a solid referral to someone who is treating patients for parasites. I have good pics and hopefully someone can identify the exact tapeworm I\u2019m infected with and explain protocols for ridding them from all parts of my body.", "target": "How can I find a specialist who will cure my tapeworm infection?"}}
