I\u2019ve never looked at myself as having an eating disorder, but during the last year I came onto other thoughts when I went on a scale and saw a tiny bit of weight loss even when I felt I was eating more. That was earlier this year. For the last while I\u2019ve had extremely difficulties eating. One meal a day is struggle enough. I want to gain weight and I want to eat. I\u2019m a size 8, but sometimes even that is slightly big. I have never looked at myself as fat and always wanted to gain weight but never really had a desire to eat unless I\u2019m super hungry or feel like I need to eat to avoid passing out. My stomach tells me to eat, but my brain informs me that I don\u2019t need food and therefore I don\u2019t eat. At my worst I feel nauseous just the tought of eating. I am super worried about this. Is there any vitamins or some sort of medication that can get me to eat even just a little bit more? Thanks.", "target": "How to overcome aversion to eating and eat regularly?"}}

{"type": "TRAIN_ENTRY", "data": {"idx": 363, "inputs": "SUBJECT: how to breathe MESSAGE: Dear Sirs,  This may seem like a stupid question but here goes anyway.  I am 64 yrs old and a type II diabetic.  I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance. I dont know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and dont's and if there is a 'better' way to breath.  Thanks very much for your help with this,  Regards,  [NAME]", "target": "What are techniques for  proper breathing?"}}
