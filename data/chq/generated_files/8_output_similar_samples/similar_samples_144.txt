My brother at age of 24 is detected with catract, however it is mild so operation is not required. But doctor said, there are chances he has this from Birth. However only from past 1.5years he had a little blur vision. And in my entire family Mom and Dad said no one has had catract from Birth. We are a big family, my grapa had 7 brothers and 2 sisters no one from their family or my mom has catract from birth or even at early age. My concern is, if i am pregnant will my children have any issue like this. I amd my sister, mom, dad we all have got our eyes checked. we dont have any issue. I am really tensed as i am expecting. Can you please help me with the answer.", "target": "Who is at risk of developing infantile cataracts?"}}

I did find this: Autosomal recessive inheritance: Two unaffected people who each carry one copy of the mutated gene for an autosomal recessive disorder (carriers) have a 25 percent chance with each pregnancy of having a child affected by the disorder. The chance with each pregnancy of having an unaffected child who is a carrier of the disorder is 50 percent, and the chance that a child will not have the disorder and will not be a carrier is 25 percent (illustration). ~[NAME]", "target": "What are the inheritance patterns for senior loken syndrome?"}}
