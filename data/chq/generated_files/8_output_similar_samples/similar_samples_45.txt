My dream is to become a Comerical Pilot and recently I undertook a medical class 1 which I failed in [LOCATION] because of my Eye position and Eye movment, hence I have not experienced any problem with my vision in daily life nor when I have been flying..  The problem is that my binocular vision is not good enough and the eye-doctor meant it could be a problem if I sudden developed double vision.  Is there any operation that can fix this? The Orthoptics I went to meant there was a problem with one of the eye muscles which where to thight and the other too weak. She said it can be fixed, but this is not &quot;normal&quot; in [LOCATION] because it is not big enough error she meant.  Is there anyway to fix this? I appreciate all information!
