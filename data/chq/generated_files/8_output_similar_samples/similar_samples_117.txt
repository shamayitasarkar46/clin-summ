I have had jock itch (just itch no rash) for 7 years. When I try to stop the itch comes back with a vengeance. I am currently using Ketoconazole 2% cream to control the itch. It appears that I am doomed to no cure but I hope I may be wrong. So, given this I have a few questions: 1. Am I still doomed or is/are there any drugs or treatments that can cure me? 2. If not, then are there any drugs that your studies have shown to be superior to Ketoconazole?  If so, will you please list up to 3 of them for me? 3. My Dermatologist suggested that I use Zeasorb antifungal powder.  Have you ever conducted a study of this? If so, how does it perform when compared to Ketoconazole or any of the drugs you may have listed in # 2 above?", "target": "What are alternative treatments to Ketoconazole for jock itch?"}}
