His dad died, his brother died 2 years ago in a motorcycle accident and about 9 months ago my dear friend got into a car accident. In that car accident he suffered a T-6 and T-7 fracture which cause him to be paralyzed from his waist down. He is so young and it really hurts how much he has suffered in his short life. Not only him, but just thinking how much his mom has suffered it really breaks my heart. I asked him how or what can I do to help him, he did not asked for money or something like, he just said: \"\"Would you help me to research how to get cured?\"\". Since I met my friend there is no one day I have stopped thinking in what can I do to make his dream come true. I know we lives in an imperfect world and things happen to people but faith moves mountains.
