She is now 20 and is in so much distress as nothing seems to alleviate the itching and soreness. She is desperate for some relief and we have tried absolutely everything - creams, shampoos, antibiotics, biopsies, blood tests, allergy tests, light therapy, diet etc. We have consulted Professors of Dermatology but they do not know how to treat it. She is now getting suicidal thoughts as it is extremely debilitating and cries a lot. They have tested for both fungal and bacterial and have grown cultures to see what attacks it - nothing does. I am writing to you for any help you could give me to try and assist her. Could you recommend a specialist and someone who could help us with research? Please could you point us in the right direction? I am happy to send through her lab tests - please let me know.

I am 64 yrs old and a type II diabetic.  I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance. I dont know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and dont's and if there is a 'better' way to breath.  Thanks very much for your help with this,  Regards,  [NAME]", "target": "What are techniques for  proper breathing?"}}
