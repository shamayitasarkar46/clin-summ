Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a \"\"new drug\"\" requiring appropriate testing.  The \"\"Vamousse\"\" head lice treatment claims \"\"Kills 100% lice and eggs\"\" and does not conform.

Was diagnosed via 495 blood sugar result and now down to 180 this morning. Pills were prescribed from ER as I have no doctor of my own and awaiting ACA insurance. My friend gave me two bottles of Metformin her mother had used before she died, and I was wondering if I could take them myself.   The first is (according to the label on the bottle) GLIP/METFORM2.5-500MTAB TEVA USA, ONE BY MOUTH EVERY DAY WITH A MEAL.

TAKE TWO TABLETS BY MOUTH IN THE MORNING AND THEN TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH IN THE EVENING. This pill is about the same size as the above listed pill, but with what looks like P., then 752. Nothing is on the opposite side.  I have to ask this because while I am waiting for my insurance to kick in, I cannot get a refill on the Metformin HCL I am taking now since I have no doctor to go through.
