I am suffering from acute pain in my right knee for the last two years. I had undergone several treatment in Allopathy, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Acu-Puncture, Physio-Therapy etc. But the results have been slow. I would be happy if you can suggest me some idea to get over the problem. I am 61 years old. The orthopaedician I consulted, advised me to go for an MRI scan and he told me that I should undergo a surgery. Many people advised me against it considering my age. What is your advice?", "target": "What are the risks of knee surgery in an older person?"}}
