I have done some of my own research and it looks like not much can be done for this condition. I do not have it all over my body it\u2019s only in my armpits. In the past I\u2019ve gone to doctors and dermatologist they gave me no answers until I looked online today and finally found out what I have. I don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m wrong. But this disease isn\u2019t even consider common because no one has done anything about it. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re thousands of women with it...

Thank you", "target": "How can I get tested and treated for trimethylaminuria?"}}
