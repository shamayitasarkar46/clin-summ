{"type": "TRAIN_ENTRY", "data": {"idx": 693, "inputs": "SUBJECT: Stroke Due to Aneurysm? MESSAGE: My son had a hemmorhagic stroke at 4 weeks of age....he is now 31 years old.  In the week leading up to the stroke he had a head cold and I had been giving  him infant cold drops.  After he had the stroke the doctors at the time could only say that it was a 'fluke' and would probably never happen again.  The reason for the stroke has haunted me ever since.  Now we just recently found out that my mother has a cerebral aneurysm and they say this can be hereditary.  So my question now is 'did my son have an aneurysm that burst or was it caused by a blood clot?...is there anyway of knowing or getting an answer to that question after the event has happened?", "target": "Can the cause of hemmorhagic stroke be determined many years later?"}}
