The Dr wanted to prescribe a pill to stop the leaking but I waited until I went back  for my one month check up, all the while leaking just as bad as I did before the surgery.  When she examined me she said the bladder had slipped out of the sling and we would have to do the surgery again this time she would suture it to the ligament behind the pelvic bone.   My question is this:  #1. why would it slip?  was she supposed to suture it before to prevent the slipping? what guarantees that it won't slip again?  I am very concerned about having to go under anesthesia again and certainly do not want to risk having to go yet a 3rd time to solve my stress incontinence issues. Thank you for ever help you can give with these answers.", "target": "What is the most effective bladder surgery for incontinence and what is its success rate?"}}

Ever since this problem started I've had terrible migraines, I gained weight (which I've tried to exercise and diet off), severe vaginal pain, cramping, heavy bleeding, blood clots the size of my hand. I've probably gone through 1000's of underwear and my life revolves around this issue. My sex life is one sided (which sucks) and I just want help..what should I do..I feel like I should have another doctor..", "target": "What are the treatments for severe vaginal bleeding?"}}
