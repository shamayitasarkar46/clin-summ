It began with pain, swelling and stiffness in my feet and  toes.A lot of the pain is joint stiff n ess and my skin feels like its being burned. Over time it has moved into my knees also. I am always tired. Recently I've been getting pains in my stomache and feeling sick. Does any of this sound like Lupus?? I've tested negative for it before, but the more I read about it I feel that's what i could have. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.", "target": "What are the symptoms of lupus?"}}
