I read about the work of his lab and I wonder if there is interest or any possibility of using pluripotent stem cells redo a piece of fabric of my bladder, for so I can do a transplant with acellular matrix and repopulate this matrix with these modified stem cells . I'm using bricker, which depress me, I lost my self esteem, lost quality of life and already thought to suicide. Until that came the hope that transplantation of acellular matrix.  I am looking forward to answer, anxious and carefully.   [NAME] CRM88878  I just can not understand the difficulty in finding a laboratory or institution that can solve this problem as the peritoneal layer of the bladder peritoneum is I already own, the inner layer is smooth muscle, which can also be acquired via endoscopic biopsy of the stomach or a arterial tissue and the layer It is coated internally by internal polymorph or transitional epithelium which can be acquired from another organ. It would just replicate small pieces so that after implanted in the acellular scaffold covered.", "target": "What is the latest research on using pluripotent stem cells and acellular matrix for  bladder regeneration?"}}
