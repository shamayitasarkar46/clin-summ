I\u2019ve never looked at myself as having an eating disorder, but during the last year I came onto other thoughts when I went on a scale and saw a tiny bit of weight loss even when I felt I was eating more. That was earlier this year. For the last while I\u2019ve had extremely difficulties eating. One meal a day is struggle enough. I want to gain weight and I want to eat. I\u2019m a size 8, but sometimes even that is slightly big. I have never looked at myself as fat and always wanted to gain weight but never really had a desire to eat unless I\u2019m super hungry or feel like I need to eat to avoid passing out. My stomach tells me to eat, but my brain informs me that I don\u2019t need food and therefore I don\u2019t eat. At my worst I feel nauseous just the tought of eating. I am super worried about this. Is there any vitamins or some sort of medication that can get me to eat even just a little bit more? Thanks.", "target": "How to overcome aversion to eating and eat regularly?"}}

I am 64 yrs old and a type II diabetic.  I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance. I dont know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and dont's and if there is a 'better' way to breath.

She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products. When she was a new born, I started giving her Lactogen (a formula milk) a little bit along with my milk. She was fine with it but after 3 weeks, I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year. She started drinking that along with my breast milk. After 2 weeks, she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day. Therefore, I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only. I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore, I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell. She was file with all the medicines. However, once the medicine stooped, she again started getting diarrhea. This continued on and off. After a while, the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her Zerolac (soy milk) along with breast feeding. I did that and everything smoothened. However, after 2 months, I asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as I was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk. The doctor asked me to give her formula milk (Nan Pro 0). I did that but just after half an hour, she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach. Once that stopped, she started getting diarrhea which continued till 3 days. She was put back on Zerolac again and breast milk. As she is now 6 months old, I thought of giving Cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again. I am unable to find the right doctor here in India where I live. Please help my daughter in this situation.
