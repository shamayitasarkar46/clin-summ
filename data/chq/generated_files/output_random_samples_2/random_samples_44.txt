Please let me know if she could join one of your clinical studies, or if you can help us to find other studies according to her case (I can send a full record of her case) I'd be really grateful. I appreciate your concern in advance.   Thank you & Best Regards, [NAME]", "target": "What clinical trials are available for hepatitis C?"}}
