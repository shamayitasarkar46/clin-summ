After taking a dose of the worm medicine (Praziquantel), I believe I\u2019m an still infected. My body is now fighting skin ulcerations I believe to be from the parasite in my muscle. I\u2019ve been trying to address that as I don\u2019t think the Rx I took was enough to rid me of the infection. My doctor is at a loss for knowing how to treat me and the referrals I\u2019ve received and numerous calls I\u2019ve made are always dead ends here in the Houston Tx area. Can you please help me? I would like some information as to how to best be completely rid of this parasite infection. I will greatly appreciate your assistance and or a solid referral to someone who is treating patients for parasites. I have good pics and hopefully someone can identify the exact tapeworm I\u2019m infected with and explain protocols for ridding them from all parts of my body.", "target": "How can I find a specialist who will cure my tapeworm infection?"}}
{"type": "TRAIN_ENTRY", "data": {"idx": 739, "inputs": "MESSAGE: Hi,I hope you can help me with my query, but if not, maybe you can point me in the right direction.I currently suffer from lower abdominal adhesions, that were diagnosed and separated in January 2013, but have since returned.To combat the pain, I have begun an application to get a neurostymulation device inserted into my lower back.However, the main reason why I am contacting you is for a second opinion on whether or not I will have difficulty or if I can pregnant. Would it be advisable to avoid pregnancy? Please know that we have always talked about adoption, so it is not the end of the world if I can't have my own kids.Also, I was told that my adhesions were caused by an appendectomy (appendix had not ruptured) I had in 2004, but as it was all keyhole surgery, I don't understand why? Please note that they also removed a small cist from both the ovaries and bowel at the the same time. I am prone to small ovarian cists that come and go on their own (most of the time).Can you help with my questions?Many Thanks for any information you have,Kind Regards,[NAME]", "target": "Can abdominal adhesions or  a neurostimulation device affect pregnancy?"}}
