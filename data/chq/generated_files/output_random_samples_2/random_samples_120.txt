I have done some of my own research and it looks like not much can be done for this condition. I do not have it all over my body it\u2019s only in my armpits. In the past I\u2019ve gone to doctors and dermatologist they gave me no answers until I looked online today and finally found out what I have. I don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m wrong. But this disease isn\u2019t even consider common because no one has done anything about it. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re thousands of women with it... Can I be tested for it and help in some kind of way to finding a cure or something?  What testing is done for this?  And where? Thank you", "target": "How can I get tested and treated for trimethylaminuria?"}}
