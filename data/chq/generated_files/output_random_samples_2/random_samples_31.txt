From knee to leg finger-end is now completely senseless. He can\u2019t feel anything like touching or byte of any mosquitoes or any insects. Both legs are now thinned too much from thigh starting point to the leg end. He did some Physio-Therapy excercise but no improvement. Dr. said that nerve has teared in some place of leg.

Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a \"\"new drug\"\" requiring appropriate testing.  The \"\"Vamousse\"\" head lice treatment claims \"\"Kills 100% lice and eggs\"\" and does not conform.  In addition, the claim \"\"kills 100%\"\" is in violation of FTC rulings which prohibit claiming \"\"100%\"\".  This company has also introduced a Head Lice Prevention product which is also in violation of FTC rulings (see FTC vs Lornamead).  I think that you should research these issues and publish your findings.  Thank you.\"", "target": "Does Vamoose head lice treatment conform to FDA and FTC labeling guidelines?"}}
