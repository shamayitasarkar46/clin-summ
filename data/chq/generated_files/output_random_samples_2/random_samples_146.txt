My hubby and i overheard her say she could not go home because they had no one to cover her.  When I was in the room alone with her and she was preparing for my surgery I clearly saw her clearing her throat coughing and touching her face covering her cough with the back of her hand.. I questioned her about the safety of her being there with a cold.. said dont worry thats why I have the mask on.. I put my trust in her went along with it.. 2 days later my nose was running profusely.. I called doctors office and they said dont worry its happens..that was a friday.. On monday I called the office and asked to be seen because my eye had started to swell..  it turns out i had developed an abscess  (endophtlamitis) now i am blind..  My understanding from reading your website the room was not sterile (air circulation) and the masks are not 100 percent germ proof..she was standing close to me handing the doctor tools i feel i was not safe with her coughing and touching them...I am looking for answers...thanks for all your help", "target": "Can a cold cause postoperative endophthalmitis?"}}
