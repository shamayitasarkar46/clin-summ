My question concerns a fall I had about 5 weeks ago.In this fall,I hurt my left wrist,and leg,my wrist took about 3 weeks to heal up,and no longer bothers me.My left leg,however,is still bothering me.Is it possible that I tore something that is pinching a nerve in my leg??While standing,for prolonged intervals my upper thigh tingles,as if my leg has gone to sleep.The front and side of my thigh are tender to touch,(as if I burnt myself badly,or someone hit me with something real hard.)The original pain I had,was in the back of my knee.I know that a tendon takes 8 weeks or more to heal,it has now been almost 6 weeks.", "target": "Why is my thigh hurting and getting numb six weeks after a fall?"}}
