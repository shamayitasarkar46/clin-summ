MESSAGE: Hi, I am writing because I have been diagnosed with depression and have been treated with several different medications because of a serious side effect I get with sertraline.  They have given me a small dosage, 25mg a day,  I have tried with Celexa, Prestiq, Paxil, Cymbalta and they all make my legs shaky.  I get weak in my legs and I get a tingling sensation.  My legs hurt and get a tingling sensastion.    Why do I get this side effect?  Is there something else I can take??  I was also wondering if it has to do with any other medications that I take.  Sometimes I take dormicum for sleeping problems and Lorazepan.    Eagerly waiting for your comments", "target": "What antidepressants are not likely to interact with lorazepam and cause weakness and tingling in my legs?"}}

I weaned myself off last year, and when I finally got to zero I started having these leg spasms, is this from the morphine? I can stop them taking 15 mgm ms contin daily which irritates me to to no end, I do NOT want to take the stuff! BUT, if I don't take it I get the spasms and end up sitting up all nite and sometimes during the day with them. I get them in my arms sometimes as well as both legs, and my legs jump a lot! My limbs feel kind of numb when it is going to start, so I know it is coming. What can I do? Is this ever going to stop?

I was told a year ago following her near death from rhabdo (CK's 150,000+), ATN, RF, respiratory compromise, to be tested for a FA metabolic error.  Until today, I really had no idea which test to request.  Her muscle bx was performed a few months ago as she was still ill last year.  Another recurrence of rhado this year prompted the bx (she is retired military).  I don't know which branch of medicine to contact for genetic testing. From  the NIH website, muscle bx is the most definitive.  I also found a phone number for the Genetics and Rare Diseases Information Center.  Thank you for some direction.", "target": "Where can I get genetic testing for CPTII deficiency?"}}
