I get different answers from different sources. One suggests that apraxia is a motor coordination disability acquired due to damage, head injury, stroke or leasions in the brain whereas dyspraxia is inherited.  Another says that the difference is absence of coordination (apraxia) versus a more mild impairment (dyspraxia).  It is very confusing to try to sort it all out.
