Dear all, I am a health professional and have recently assessed a 9 year old boy on my caseload whose mother reported that he has been diagnosed with 16p-13.11 duplication of genes.  I have never come across it and when I looked on the internet I could not find anything coherent.  I have been in contact with the paediatrician who used to be in charge of that child but she is unfortunately on long term sick.  Would you be able to give me some information on this condition with key features please? Are there behavioural, coordination, sensory difficulties, etc...that can be associated with it?", "target": "Where can I find information on 16p-13.11 duplication, including symptoms?"}}
