I\u2019ve never looked at myself as having an eating disorder, but during the last year I came onto other thoughts when I went on a scale and saw a tiny bit of weight loss even when I felt I was eating more. That was earlier this year. For the last while I\u2019ve had extremely difficulties eating. One meal a day is struggle enough. I want to gain weight and I want to eat. I\u2019m a size 8, but sometimes even that is slightly big. I have never looked at myself as fat and always wanted to gain weight but never really had a desire to eat unless I\u2019m super hungry or feel like I need to eat to avoid passing out. My stomach tells me to eat, but my brain informs me that I don\u2019t need food and therefore I don\u2019t eat. At my worst I feel nauseous just the tought of eating. I am super worried about this. Is there any vitamins or some sort of medication that can get me to eat even just a little bit more? Thanks.", "target": "How to overcome aversion to eating and eat regularly?"}}

At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life!
