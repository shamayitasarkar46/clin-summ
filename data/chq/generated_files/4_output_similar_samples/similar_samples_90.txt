In the week leading up to the stroke he had a head cold and I had been giving  him infant cold drops.  After he had the stroke the doctors at the time could only say that it was a 'fluke' and would probably never happen again.  The reason for the stroke has haunted me ever since.  Now we just recently found out that my mother has a cerebral aneurysm and they say this can be hereditary.  So my question now is 'did my son have an aneurysm that burst or was it caused by a blood clot?...is there anyway of knowing or getting an answer to that question after the event has happened?", "target": "Can the cause of hemmorhagic stroke be determined many years later?"}}

I have been following the instruction since then; I went to another doctor who advised me to go for physiotherapy (Short Wave Diathermy) and advised me some exercises. I have been following them too. But yet now, I have not been fully recovered from the pain. Especially when I try to walk quickly or try to put pressure with my left leg, I feel pain. I am very tensed about this.

{"type": "TRAIN_ENTRY", "data": {"idx": 363, "inputs": "SUBJECT: how to breathe MESSAGE: Dear Sirs,  This may seem like a stupid question but here goes anyway.  I am 64 yrs old and a type II diabetic.  I walk frequently to stay fairly fit but always seem to get out of breath when going up even gentle hills. Today however I noticed that I could change how I breath. Thus, I could force air out using my diaphram (ie like blowing out a candle)then relax and just let the air flow back in or I could use my diaphram to suck in air (like breathing in the morning air)and again relax my diaphram to push it out. I also found that I could breath faster under conscious control which seemd to help my performance. I dont know if any of this makes sense to you but I would like to know what you think and whether there are any do's and dont's and if there is a 'better' way to breath.  Thanks very much for your help with this,  Regards,  [NAME]", "target": "What are techniques for  proper breathing?"}}
