{"type": "TEST_ENTRY", "data": {"idx": 1161, "inputs": "Good morning.  I have a question for a urologist or a surgeon.  This may be out there but I am not one to go with the flow.  Now I do not have prostate cancer but I like being ready for anything.  I will be having a blood test next week and then I will be seeing my doctor.  My PSA was up from the last few.  2015 - 0.4   2016 - 0.7 and 2017 - 2.2.  Now here is my question.   If I get prostate cancer and lets say that the tumor is in the right lobe can I just have the right lobe removed.  Nothing else.  Maybe the lymph node on that side but I do not want anything else removed  I do not want the bladder neck touch or the seminal vesicles or the other side of the prostate.  I know you must think this is crazy but I feel my sex life and my ejaculation is just as important to save as getting rid of the cancer.  I have been reading to many articles that say they take every because you may get cancer there.  So you are going to take out good tissue just because you may get it again.  I don't believe in that.  My urologist call me his challenge.  I do not give up total control.  Thank you for your time.  I hope you have a great day.

I just want to know something about milking,  I am 24 years old virgin and when I press my nipples, some sort of white fluid is coming out of my nipples. I live in a remote area, Should I see a doctor or is it normal to milk while pressing nipples.. I have never taken any serious medications before, so why am I milking..?? Or is it a hormonal disorder if so why? Really need your answer or advice on this, is it a life threatening symptom? I am really fearful..   Looking forward to hearing from you,   Thank you so much for reading my email.. Blessings, [NAME]", "target": "What are the causes of nipple discharge?"}}
