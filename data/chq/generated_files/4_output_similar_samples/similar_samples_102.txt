After taking a dose of the worm medicine (Praziquantel), I believe I\u2019m an still infected. My body is now fighting skin ulcerations I believe to be from the parasite in my muscle. I\u2019ve been trying to address that as I don\u2019t think the Rx I took was enough to rid me of the infection. My doctor is at a loss for knowing how to treat me and the referrals I\u2019ve received and numerous calls I\u2019ve made are always dead ends here in the Houston Tx area. Can you please help me? I would like some information as to how to best be completely rid of this parasite infection. I will greatly appreciate your assistance and or a solid referral to someone who is treating patients for parasites. I have good pics and hopefully someone can identify the exact tapeworm I\u2019m infected with and explain protocols for ridding them from all parts of my body.", "target": "How can I find a specialist who will cure my tapeworm infection?"}}

I have had jock itch (just itch no rash) for 7 years. When I try to stop the itch comes back with a vengeance. I am currently using Ketoconazole 2% cream to control the itch. It appears that I am doomed to no cure but I hope I may be wrong. So, given this I have a few questions: 1. Am I still doomed or is/are there any drugs or treatments that can cure me? 2. If not, then are there any drugs that your studies have shown to be superior to Ketoconazole?  If so, will you please list up to 3 of them for me? 3. My Dermatologist suggested that I use Zeasorb antifungal powder.  Have you ever conducted a study of this? If so, how does it perform when compared to Ketoconazole or any of the drugs you may have listed in # 2 above?", "target": "What are alternative treatments to Ketoconazole for jock itch?"}}
