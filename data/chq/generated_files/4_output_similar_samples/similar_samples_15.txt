I was recently taken off of Wellbutrin HCL XL completely without any tapering. I'm having a difficult time finding out online if this is safe (to \"\"go cold turkey\"\") or if I should have been given the medication in slowly-decreasing doses.

I have many and more related questions about storing pills at various temperatures that I would like to ask about, but let's start with that question. The drugs that I am concerned about are digoxin and lisinopril. As far as I know, the dosage is the lowest possible prescribed dosage for each medication (if that matters). I hope my question will not be thought of as a specific, or individually based question and you are able to answer in the most broad and objective way. Thank you very much in advance.", "target": "Will storing digoxin and lisinopril in the freezer reduce their efficacy? "}}
