query 1: SUBJECT: Need help! MESSAGE: I have a knot about the size of a BB in my right forearm about 2-3 inches from my elbow. It's been there for about 5 years and hurts sometimes. Mostly only notice it when i put pressure on it. You can't see it but can feel it pretty good. It will move about a cm in any direction. I went to the doctors about 4 years ago to have it looked at but they did no xray and said its prob a BB from when i was younger. It's starting to hurt more now without me putting pressure on it so i'm thinking i need to have something done about it. Any ideas on what it could be or what i should do about it?
