query 1: "SUBJECT: Vamousse head lice treatment labe claims MESSAGE: To the best of my knowledge, any head lice treatment that claims to ""Kill"" lice and/or eggs is considered by FDA to be a drug claim and therefore needs to contain an FDA-registered pediculicide (kills lice) or an FDA-approved ovicide (kills eggs).  Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a ""new drug"" requiring appropriate testing.  The ""Vamousse"" head lice treatment claims ""Kills 100% lice and eggs"" and does not conform.  In addition, the claim ""kills 100%"" is in violation of FTC rulings which prohibit claiming ""100%"".  This company has also introduced a Head Lice Prevention product which is also in violation of FTC rulings (see FTC vs Lornamead).  I think that you should research these issues and publish your findings.  Thank you."

query 3: Few years ago (like 3yrs) my uncle faced a massive accident. His back-bone broken, right leg anklet broken. He treated his backbone from Trauma Centre. Some steel plates and screws added with his backbone and his backbone is now completely ok. The problem is now with his both leg. From knee to leg finger-end is now completely senseless. He canâ€™t feel anything like touching or byte of any mosquitoes or any insects. Both legs are now thinned too much from thigh starting point to the leg end. He did some Physio-Therapy excercise but no improvement. Dr. said that nerve has teared in some place of leg. Now I want to know is there any therapy/treatment available to get rid of this kind of injury? How it can be cured and where is the treatment available? What kind of treatment is need to get cure?
