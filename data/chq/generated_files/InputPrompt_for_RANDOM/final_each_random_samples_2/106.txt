query 2: Clinical Studies - Hep C Dear Madam / Sir,   I am looking for clinical studies on Hep C and I want to know if my mother could participate in any of these studies ,she is 65 years old and she suffers from Hep C in stage between 3 & 4, she has liver cirrhosis and it caused variceal bleeding, so she gets an Endoscopic variceal ligation every 3 months . the new treatment is not available in Egypt yet and we are not sure when it will be or if it will ever be ! it's very risky to wait in my mom's case, and we can't afford the cost of the treatment abroad!! Please let me know if she could join one of your clinical studies, or if you can help us to find other studies according to her case (I can send a full record of her case) I'd be really grateful. I appreciate your concern in advance.   Thank you & Best Regards, [NAME]
