query 1: SUBJECT: NEUROFIBROMATOSIS MESSAGE: Hi:  I have neurofibromatosis handed down by my Mother, (from what we understand was from spontaneous mutation).  I was diagnosed with an Optic Giloma about 25 years ago.  I have also been getting MRI’s to keep an “eye” on it (excuse the pun please), along with visual fields.  The last MRI, according to the radiologist, said it was not there and my Neurologist told me that they do disappear.  My question is, do Optic Giloma go away?  Thanks
