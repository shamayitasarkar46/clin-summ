I have color in my hair (brown) and in my eyes (hazel) they do not shake. My skin is fair but my markings are visible. It is not one solid fair white on all of me. I apparently have 3 different levels. most of my body is covered by level 1 pigmentation (the fairest) i have level 2 on some as well and a small patch of my arm of level (3) it basically looks like a huge birthmark that goes from my right side of the body to the left.  When I was born the doctors still didn't know much about Albinism and I""m hoping to learn more myself. For instance what type this would fall under... I hope you can help. Sincerely, [NAME]"
