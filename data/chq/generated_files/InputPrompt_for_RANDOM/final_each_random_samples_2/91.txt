query 1: SUBJECT: affects from being molested MESSAGE: I was molested by my father when I was a child (over 45 years ago).  I've been working on recovery the past couple of years (the memories surfaced in 2010).  As part of my recovery, I'm exploring how being sodomized by my father may have damaged my rectum and surrounding areas.    What kinds of physical damage would have been done by a 22 year old male sodomizing a 5 year old boy?    I'm looking to see if that caused tears in the rectum that would have lead to having to have 9 surgeries as an adult to repair them.  I don't think they just happened.  thanks in advance.
summarized question 1: Where can I find information on rectal damage caused by anal sex?

query 3: SUBJECT: Setraline side effects. MESSAGE: Hi, I am writing because I have been diagnosed with depression and have been treated with several different medications because of a serious side effect I get with sertraline.  They have given me a small dosage, 25mg a day,  I have tried with Celexa, Prestiq, Paxil, Cymbalta and they all make my legs shaky.  I get weak in my legs and I get a tingling sensation.  My legs hurt and get a tingling sensastion.    Why do I get this side effect?  Is there something else I can take??  I was also wondering if it has to do with any other medications that I take.  Sometimes I take dormicum for sleeping problems and Lorazepan.    Eagerly waiting for your comments
