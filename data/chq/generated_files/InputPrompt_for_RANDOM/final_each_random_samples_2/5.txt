query 1: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information.  I am from Canada, was injured in august at work,,some neurologists that I have seen, have suggested that I might have complex regional pain syndrome, but due to my hand gnarling, they dismiss it. I have not been diagnosed, so I am trying to find a diagnosis so my arm could be repaired. Any suggestions would be very welcome. Thank you! [NAME]

query 3: Gadolinum toxicity and MCS relationship? I have 2 Genovia Labs test results years apart with seriously high Gadolinum toxicity. AND I am very VERY VERY very challenged by MCS - Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. My question is: If I had multiple MARs after an auto accident. And since then the MCS is debilitating. Certainly the symptoms of Gas level in my body cause symptoms as well. But I am debilitated by Synthetic chemicals in the air.  How can I find out if the Gas exhaserbated my reaction to exhaust fumes, air fresheners, perfumes, dryer sheets(!!!!), food additives, and much more. Many Thanks
