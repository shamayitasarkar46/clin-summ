query 1: Thank you for your response to my inquiry about the MMR vaccine.  I was born in 1942, never had the 10-day measles but did have the 3-day measles, and did have mumps as a child.  A recent blood test indicated that I am not immune to Rubella so my doctor recommended I get the MMR vaccine.  In light of my age, etc., do you agree or do you feel it is unnecessary or is there a separate vaccine for just Rubella?  Which is the measles that has started to reappear?
