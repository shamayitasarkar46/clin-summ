query 1: Hello - I suspect my son has Cushing's Syndrome. His recent U-Creatinine Excretion 24 hr urine test showed 21.6H nnol/d. The lab range for normal is 7.0-17.0. I suspect this may be the result of muscle waste. Can you please tell me what this measure means in terms of the scale of the result - what does this difference represent and what can be expected as a result. Also how can we determine whether it is muscle waste that is the issue? Please help
