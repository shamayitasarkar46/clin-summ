query 1: genetic condition passed from mother. I am looking for the name of a genetic condition passed on from the mother. Female children are carriers, but only male children are symptomatic. It is often mistaken for a milk protein allergy, causes excessive spitting up and hiccups, and rounded teeth. Often male children do not make it to their 1st birthday. I have lost two boys, and am about to have a third, i desperately need to find the name of this condition. Please help, my childs life depends on it. My doctors say they do not know what to test for or how to proceed without a name.
