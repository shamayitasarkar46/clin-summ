query 1: SUBJECT: Peyronies Disease - Questions MESSAGE: Dear sir/Madam  my name is [NAME]. i am 16 years old and i live in [LOCATION]. i have a couple of questions about Peyronies Disease.  i have recently discovered about this ... STD (or should i call it a disease?) and i noticed that i also have a bent penis , but none of the following points , which are on the Peyronies Page , match my Penis (ofcourse besides the bend). so i was wondering. is it also possible to get a bent penis just from masturbation? because if that is so , then i may know where the problem lies with me (i may have to switch hands then :/ )  i hope you can answer my questions. hope to hear from you soon.  -[NAME]
