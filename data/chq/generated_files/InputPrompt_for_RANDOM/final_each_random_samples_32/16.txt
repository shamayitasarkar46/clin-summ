query 14: Metformin varieties.  As of today, I have been on Metformin HCL 500MG twice a day, for two weeks now. Was diagnosed via 495 blood sugar result and now down to 180 this morning. Pills were prescribed from ER as I have no doctor of my own and awaiting ACA insurance. My friend gave me two bottles of Metformin her mother had used before she died, and I was wondering if I could take them myself.   The first is (according to the label on the bottle) GLIP/METFORM2.5-500MTAB TEVA USA, ONE BY MOUTH EVERY DAY WITH A MEAL. The pill is white, flat sides, oval shaped, and has 7456 on one side and 93 on the other.   The second says GLYB/METFORM 2.5/500TAB ACTAV MID Generic for GLUCOVANCE 2.5/500 TAB. TAKE TWO TABLETS BY MOUTH IN THE MORNING AND THEN TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH IN THE EVENING. This pill is about the same size as the above listed pill, but with what looks like P., then 752. Nothing is on the opposite side.  I have to ask this because while I am waiting for my insurance to kick in, I cannot get a refill on the Metformin HCL I am taking now since I have no doctor to go through. So, if these extras I was given are just as generic as mine, can I take them? Would I adjust the dosage? And, if so, how should I take them (dosage and how many a day)? Being poor sucks, so I hope you can help me out... Thanks!  [NAME]
