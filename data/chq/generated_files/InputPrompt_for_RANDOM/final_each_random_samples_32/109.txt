query 7: SUBJECT: CPTII Deficiency MESSAGE: My sister in Texas was just diagnosed with CPTII deficiency today.  We do not yet know which variant.  I was told a year ago following her near death from rhabdo (CK's 150,000+), ATN, RF, respiratory compromise, to be tested for a FA metabolic error.  Until today, I really had no idea which test to request.  Her muscle bx was performed a few months ago as she was still ill last year.  Another recurrence of rhado this year prompted the bx (she is retired military).  I don't know which branch of medicine to contact for genetic testing. From  the NIH website, muscle bx is the most definitive.  I also found a phone number for the Genetics and Rare Diseases Information Center.  Thank you for some direction.

query 27: "SUBJECT: Levalbuterol and Budesonide Inhalation Products MESSAGE: After calling TEVA Pharmaceuticals, they relayed that the stability and storage information printed on their Levalbuterol 1.25 mg/3 mL and 0.63 mg/3 mL Inhalation Solution, as well as their Budesonide 0.5 mg/2 mL and 0.25 mg/2 mL Inhalation Suspension packages is information directly pulled from DailyMed, hence NIH. I am trying to determine if there is any extended stability information for either product, as the nebs are not singly packaged, and therefore a significant amount of product is being wasted in our facility due to the information provided. When name brand Xopenex was still available, Sepracor was able to provide our facility with more stablity information that enabled us to refrigerate the product in the foil pouch, continuing to protect it from light: i.e., ""allows use of product through its labeled expiry."" It would be greatly appreciated if some additional information could be provided regarding the above situation. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

query 31: SUBJECT: Mayonnaise and food poisoning MESSAGE: I have researched many other sites that say that mayonnaise is a safe food and that it is a myth that it causes food poisoning.  It seems to get a bad rap because it is used in combination with other items that cause food poisoning.  Some sites insist that it can even prevent the onslaught of bacterial growth, thus helping to ward off food poisoning because of its acidic nature.  Apparently it often used to be made at home, with eggs, and the eggs would go bad.....mayonnaise has thus carried this stigma ever since.  But many sites insist it is safe.  I was wondering what you think of these findings?   Thank you!
