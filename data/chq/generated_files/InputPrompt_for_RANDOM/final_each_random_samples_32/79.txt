query 27: SUBJECT: concussions and long term head trauma  from abuse Ii MESSAGE: I was a victim from an abusive relationship, both verbal and physical. During this time I received substantial injuries to my head. Slight concussions led to full-fledged concussions, losing the ability to talk very well, then think very well, and a subdural hematoma, on the left side, bled down inside my head to behind my left eye, which made it unable to move. Along with an intense headache and drinking a lot of coffee, the neurosurgeon didn't have to do brain surgery,  as my eye finally moved!Battered Women's told me to get out of the area a stay gone if I wanted to stay alive. So I did! Speech Therapy helped considerably, the story goes on.  Anyway, I hear and read a lot about concussions and head trauma for football players,  young and old,  and wonder if any studies have ever been done for women?   A few years ago,  I had a partial stroke,  but enough to set me back a bit.  But this time I know what I need to do to help fix my head,  again.
