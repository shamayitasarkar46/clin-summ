My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder (at Yale) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations. What would be the best way to proceed? Is there anyone out there looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other disorders that might be interested in our ""story""?"
