query 2: SUBJECT: Shortness of breath MESSAGE: Thank you for your tip on being short of breath upon doing simple chores around the house.  I have done what you told me, breath through nose then let it out through pursed lips.  Works for me, but I'm constantly out of breath my doctor checked my heart and lungs with his stethoscope and says all is fine.  However I do suffer from hypertension and high blood pressure, and take medication for it.  I'm 71 years old and would like to know if losing a bit of weight and walking would help me further, I need to toughen up my muscles because I tire kind of too easily, makes me feel like I'm lazy which I am not used to, I need to be doing things all the time.  I'm a kitty cat caregiver and take in strays and look after them so you can imagine the work required, litter boxes to lift, bowls of water, food bags, vet care and just a lot of running around doing this and that for the kitties.  Any suggestion from you would be appreciated.
