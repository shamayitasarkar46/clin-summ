query 1: Customer Service Request.  My daughter has Turner syndrome but she's beaten all odds. She developed on our own, got her period on her own, she is now pregnant on her own with identical twins. My question is can she have normal children or do they have more of a chance of having Turner syndrome.  My daughter has been tested many times to confirm her diagnosis of Turner syndrome and she is a full XO not mosaic but still does not display many of the characteristics. Again, I am just questioning the safety of the pregnancy and the health of the babies. Thank you for your help

query 2: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study MESSAGE: My name is [NAME] and I am 76 years old. I have had jock itch (just itch no rash) for 7 years. When I try to stop the itch comes back with a vengeance. I am currently using Ketoconazole 2% cream to control the itch. It appears that I am doomed to no cure but I hope I may be wrong. So, given this I have a few questions: 1. Am I still doomed or is/are there any drugs or treatments that can cure me? 2. If not, then are there any drugs that your studies have shown to be superior to Ketoconazole?  If so, will you please list up to 3 of them for me? 3. My Dermatologist suggested that I use Zeasorb antifungal powder.  Have you ever conducted a study of this? If so, how does it perform when compared to Ketoconazole or any of the drugs you may have listed in # 2 above?
