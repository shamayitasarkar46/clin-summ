query 1: SUBJECT: Theophyline MESSAGE: I have been taking this drug since 1994.  Now my PCP will not prescribe it and has sent me to a pulmonary specialist who will also not prescribe it.  She wants me to take more expensive drugs such as Advair Diskus. Neither doctor has performed a serum Theophyline level.  The pulmonologist performed a PFt and ordered a methachlorine test which I cancelled.  I don't have asthma I have bronchitis.  Both doctors told me that it was extremely dangerous to take this drug for this long of a period.  I have had no problems with it.  Now that I have stopped taking it I don't feel as well as I did with it.  My questions are is it dangerous to take Theophyline long term? Should they have stopped the drug suddenly Like they did?  Please help me.  Thanks, [NAME] (I am 57 years old)

query 3: "SUBJECT: Levalbuterol and Budesonide Inhalation Products MESSAGE: After calling TEVA Pharmaceuticals, they relayed that the stability and storage information printed on their Levalbuterol 1.25 mg/3 mL and 0.63 mg/3 mL Inhalation Solution, as well as their Budesonide 0.5 mg/2 mL and 0.25 mg/2 mL Inhalation Suspension packages is information directly pulled from DailyMed, hence NIH. I am trying to determine if there is any extended stability information for either product, as the nebs are not singly packaged, and therefore a significant amount of product is being wasted in our facility due to the information provided. When name brand Xopenex was still available, Sepracor was able to provide our facility with more stablity information that enabled us to refrigerate the product in the foil pouch, continuing to protect it from light: i.e., ""allows use of product through its labeled expiry."" It would be greatly appreciated if some additional information could be provided regarding the above situation. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
