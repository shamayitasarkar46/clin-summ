query 6: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study MESSAGE: Are there any studies looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other related disorders? We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations (only 1 male in each), My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder as a child (at [LOCATION]) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and very similar intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations. What would be the best way to proceed?
