query 5: SUBJECT: Apraxia and Dyspraxia MESSAGE: What are the basic differences between apraxia and dyspraxia?  I get different answers from different sources. One suggests that apraxia is a motor coordination disability acquired due to damage, head injury, stroke or leasions in the brain whereas dyspraxia is inherited.  Another says that the difference is absence of coordination (apraxia) versus a more mild impairment (dyspraxia).  It is very confusing to try to sort it all out.  Thank you!

query 9: Hello, I have been dealing with trimethylaminuria since I was a child. I have done some of my own research and it looks like not much can be done for this condition. I do not have it all over my body it’s only in my armpits. In the past I’ve gone to doctors and dermatologist they gave me no answers until I looked online today and finally found out what I have. I don’t know maybe I’m wrong. But this disease isn’t even consider common because no one has done anything about it. I’m sure they’re thousands of women with it... Can I be tested for it and help in some kind of way to finding a cure or something?  What testing is done for this?  And where? Thank you
