My dream is to become a Comerical Pilot and recently I undertook a medical class 1 which I failed in [LOCATION] because of my Eye position and Eye movment, hence I have not experienced any problem with my vision in daily life nor when I have been flying..

The Orthoptics I went to meant there was a problem with one of the eye muscles which where to thight and the other too weak. She said it can be fixed, but this is not &quot;normal&quot; in [LOCATION] because it is not big enough error she meant.  Is there anyway to fix this? I appreciate all information!

query 4: SUBJECT: Carbon Monoxide MESSAGE: Once you are exposed to Carbon Monoxide and the source of the leak is found and resolved (i.e., source is Furnace and shut off by the Gas Company), and the air is clear, is it still necessary to have the oxygen treatments and/or blood tests, or, do the levels in your body go back to normal afterwards.  I understand that there could be long term effects based on the term of the exposure, but, if you do not lose consciousness, are the treatments still necessary?  Should someone still have oxygen treatment, blood-work, CT scans, heart/lung scans if the problem has been resolved and air is clear?  It has been over 48 hours since the exposure.
