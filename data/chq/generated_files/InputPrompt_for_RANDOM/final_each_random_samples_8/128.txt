query 4: Metformin varieties.  As of today, I have been on Metformin HCL 500MG twice a day, for two weeks now. Was diagnosed via 495 blood sugar result and now down to 180 this morning. Pills were prescribed from ER as I have no doctor of my own and awaiting ACA insurance. My friend gave me two bottles of Metformin her mother had used before she died, and I was wondering if I could take them myself.   The first is (according to the label on the bottle) GLIP/METFORM2.5-500MTAB TEVA USA, ONE BY MOUTH EVERY DAY WITH A MEAL. The pill is white, flat sides, oval shaped, and has 7456 on one side and 93 on the other.   The second says GLYB/METFORM 2.5/500TAB ACTAV MID Generic for GLUCOVANCE 2.5/500 TAB. TAKE TWO TABLETS BY MOUTH IN THE MORNING AND THEN TAKE ONE TABLET BY MOUTH IN THE EVENING. This pill is about the same size as the above listed pill, but with what looks like P., then 752. Nothing is on the opposite side.  I have to ask this because while I am waiting for my insurance to kick in, I cannot get a refill on the Metformin HCL I am taking now since I have no doctor to go through. So, if these extras I was given are just as generic as mine, can I take them? Would I adjust the dosage? And, if so, how should I take them (dosage and how many a day)? Being poor sucks, so I hope you can help me out... Thanks!  [NAME]

query 6: MESSAGE: Hi,I hope you can help me with my query, but if not, maybe you can point me in the right direction.I currently suffer from lower abdominal adhesions, that were diagnosed and separated in January 2013, but have since returned.To combat the pain, I have begun an application to get a neurostymulation device inserted into my lower back.However, the main reason why I am contacting you is for a second opinion on whether or not I will have difficulty or if I can pregnant. Would it be advisable to avoid pregnancy? Please know that we have always talked about adoption, so it is not the end of the world if I can't have my own kids.Also, I was told that my adhesions were caused by an appendectomy (appendix had not ruptured) I had in 2004, but as it was all keyhole surgery, I don't understand why? Please note that they also removed a small cist from both the ovaries and bowel at the the same time. I am prone to small ovarian cists that come and go on their own (most of the time).Can you help with my questions?Many Thanks for any information you have,Kind Regards,[NAME]
