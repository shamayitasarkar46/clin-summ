query 6: SUBJECT: uncontrollable jerking movements MESSAGE: When I am exercising hard, the left side of my body will start to do strange things. When lifting weights overhead, my left upper lift will jerk up into sort of a sneer.  When doing core work, my left arm will start jerking so hard that it's impossible to hold onto anything. The jerking stops after the exercise ends; but my left arm feels worn out.  No pain. A few months ago, my left leg completely lost any strength for weeks. It first appeared when I was just trying to do a squat with a plastic pipe in my hand. Eventually was able to work strength back. Again - no pain.  Should I be alarmed?

query 9: Hello. I have been a small eater my entire life, but always had difficulties eating. I’ve never looked at myself as having an eating disorder, but during the last year I came onto other thoughts when I went on a scale and saw a tiny bit of weight loss even when I felt I was eating more. That was earlier this year. For the last while I’ve had extremely difficulties eating. One meal a day is struggle enough. I want to gain weight and I want to eat. I’m a size 8, but sometimes even that is slightly big. I have never looked at myself as fat and always wanted to gain weight but never really had a desire to eat unless I’m super hungry or feel like I need to eat to avoid passing out. My stomach tells me to eat, but my brain informs me that I don’t need food and therefore I don’t eat. At my worst I feel nauseous just the tought of eating. I am super worried about this. Is there any vitamins or some sort of medication that can get me to eat even just a little bit more? Thanks.
