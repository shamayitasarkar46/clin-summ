query 3: I understand that you cannot provide opinions,nor suggest, any type of therpy.  My son (dob-[DATE]), was called back to the hospital four days after birth due to a abnormal PKU, which suggested adrenal hyperplasia. After test the endocrine physians felt he did not have the condition. Several years later he began having severe headaches preceded by violent vomiting epidodes  that lasted for hours. When he was admitted to [LOCATION],  he was suffering from bleeding esphogal ulcers,  and severe dehydration and, malnutrician. His urine (24 hr), blood plasma,& VMA,showed increased values of catacholomines.He also demostrated intermittent hypertension, and tachcardia through out the day (he had been diagnoised with ADHD several years earlier). His MIGB clearly showed bifocal uptake in both adrenal glands. The mri did not show tumors at that time ([DATE].

query 9: I an autoimmune disease and suffer with MCS. Recently I purchased a new combustion heater and went away for the first week while my friend burned it daily to allow the paint to cure. However when I returned, each time I lit it, after 1/2 a hour this pungent toxic burning plastic smell filles the house causing my mouth to burn, a rash on my face, a whooshing sound in my ears. I couldn't make a decision, had an urgency to defecate and then fight and flight panic affected so badly I had to leave my home. I had the manufactures come to my home but the didn't wait long enough for the smell to start, there were more concerned with the function of the unit, no the toxic smell. The did admit that the flu had not been correctly installed and they are going to rectify that however they assured me that the smell I described would not be coming from the fire. So I tried it again and the smell reoccurred, this time I got a friend to come and help. He suggested it might be the new vinyl flooring of gassing as the house heated up. ( I had recently had a reno done. My issue is that I need to identify what is making me ill so I can avoid it. If it proves to be the floor I will get rid of it. I cant live in my home under these conditions as this chemical effects me so much it makes me literally crazy. I cant talk, I get confused, I cry then I panic and run. This week the chemical messed with my head so badly I drove in the path of a truck? Lucky he has just started up and missed me. I just sat in the car and cried. I really really need the help of a specialist. Where do I go from here? Kindest regards
