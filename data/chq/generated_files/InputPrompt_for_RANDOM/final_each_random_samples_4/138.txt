query 1: SUBJECT: Need glucosamine sulfate not containing shellfish meats MESSAGE: Can you please help me? I have been taking a glucosamine sulfate product with MSM for my arthritis. My nutritionist warned me I could develop a shellfish allergy if it is made from the shellfish meat. The customer service of the product that I am taking confirmed their product is made from the shellfish meat of 3 crustaceans. Can you direct me to how I can find this product not made from the meats, but the shells instead. (I don't want the vegetarian version because it is so hard on the stomach). I appreciate your help.
