query 4: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - general information MESSAGE: Dear Team, In 1996, I had an accident on my left eye when a ball smashed it. Retina fallen down, lens damaged. I hadn't been operated at that point only later, in 2003 when the pressure was very high (above 30 mp). This first operation had fixed the retina with endolaser, removed vitreous body filled with silicone oil, replaced the lens with an artificial one and stabilized the pressure to around 15-10 mp. However, the eye got blood, retina got detached and it had to be operated again. This time, the oil replaced with gas. After 2 years, another attempt made with oil and lastly with gas, but the retina fallen again and again. Currently, the retina is still detached, the pressure is low (max 4 mp), has often blood around the iris and it hurts a bit when the air pressure changes. I cannot see anything with it apart from blur lights. The doctor says, this damaged eye is shrinking continuously. My other eye functioning well. I learned to live together with it, however, the doctor says, he strongly recommends enucleation. I dont know if there is any other option to avoid enucleation. I have 2 young children so if there were any option to avoid enucleatio, I would happy travel/pay for that. Kindly let me know if there is any other option. My main priority -if available- would be to live with my own or another organic eye which doesn't look scary even if it is not functional. Second priority is to have usable organic eye- but my doctor told, this is not yet possible. Please confirm. I know you are specialized in Thank you in advance -- Best regards, [CONTACT] [NAME]
summarized question 4: What are alternatives to enucleation?
