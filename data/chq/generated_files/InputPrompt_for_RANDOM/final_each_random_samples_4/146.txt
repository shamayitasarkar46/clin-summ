query 4: I understand that you cannot provide opinions,nor suggest, any type of therpy.  My son (dob-[DATE]), was called back to the hospital four days after birth due to a abnormal PKU, which suggested adrenal hyperplasia. After test the endocrine physians felt he did not have the condition. Several years later he began having severe headaches preceded by violent vomiting epidodes  that lasted for hours.

His urine (24 hr), blood plasma,& VMA,showed increased values of catacholomines.He also demostrated intermittent hypertension, and tachcardia through out the day (he had been diagnoised with ADHD several years earlier). His MIGB clearly showed bifocal uptake in both adrenal glands. The mri did not show tumors at that time ([DATE].

His symptons that I have not already include heat intolerence, pallor, poor appetite with little weight gain, anxiety, tremor of hands, and stomach pain.

query 5: I am trying to get some information.  I had eye surgery.  My surgical tech was clearly sick.  My hubby and i overheard her say she could not go home because they had no one to cover her.  When I was in the room alone with her and she was preparing for my surgery I clearly saw her clearing her throat coughing and touching her face covering her cough with the back of her hand.. I questioned her about the safety of her being there with a cold.. said dont worry thats why I have the mask on.. I put my trust in her went along with it.. 2 days later my nose was running profusely.. I called doctors office and they said dont worry its happens..that was a friday.. On monday I called the office and asked to be seen because my eye had started to swell..  it turns out i had developed an abscess  (endophtlamitis) now i am blind..  My understanding from reading your website the room was not sterile (air circulation) and the masks are not 100 percent germ proof..she was standing close to me handing the doctor tools i feel i was not safe with her coughing and touching them...I am looking for answers...thanks for all your help
