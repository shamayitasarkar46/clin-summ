query 5: Hello, I have been dealing with trimethylaminuria since I was a child. I have done some of my own research and it looks like not much can be done for this condition. I do not have it all over my body it’s only in my armpits. In the past I’ve gone to doctors and dermatologist they gave me no answers until I looked online today and finally found out what I have. I don’t know maybe I’m wrong. But this disease isn’t even consider common because no one has done anything about it. I’m sure they’re thousands of women with it... Can I be tested for it and help in some kind of way to finding a cure or something?  What testing is done for this?  And where? Thank you
