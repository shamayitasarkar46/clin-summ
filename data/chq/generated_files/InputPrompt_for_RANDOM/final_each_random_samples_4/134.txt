query 2: SUBJECT: Theophyline MESSAGE: I have been taking this drug since 1994.  Now my PCP will not prescribe it and has sent me to a pulmonary specialist who will also not prescribe it.  She wants me to take more expensive drugs such as Advair Diskus. Neither doctor has performed a serum Theophyline level.  The pulmonologist performed a PFt and ordered a methachlorine test which I cancelled.  I don't have asthma I have bronchitis.  Both doctors told me that it was extremely dangerous to take this drug for this long of a period.  I have had no problems with it.  Now that I have stopped taking it I don't feel as well as I did with it.  My questions are is it dangerous to take Theophyline long term? Should they have stopped the drug suddenly Like they did?  Please help me.  Thanks, [NAME] (I am 57 years old)
