query 1: SUBJECT: affects from being molested MESSAGE: I was molested by my father when I was a child (over 45 years ago).  I've been working on recovery the past couple of years (the memories surfaced in 2010).  As part of my recovery, I'm exploring how being sodomized by my father may have damaged my rectum and surrounding areas.    What kinds of physical damage would have been done by a 22 year old male sodomizing a 5 year old boy?    I'm looking to see if that caused tears in the rectum that would have lead to having to have 9 surgeries as an adult to repair them.  I don't think they just happened.  thanks in advance.
