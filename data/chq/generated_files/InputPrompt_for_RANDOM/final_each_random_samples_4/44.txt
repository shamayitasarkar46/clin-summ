query 2: SUBJECT: PERIDONTITIS LEFT UNTREATED EFFECTS MESSAGE: Hi, If periodontitis is left untreated for approx 7 months will it have any affect on the condition as I need to travel.  A dentist has told me I have mod-advanced periodontitis with gum pockets of 5-9mm and bone loss 20-50>% with restorations and caries.  I have all my teeth at this stage, some are loose.  If I leave it for this amount of time is it likely to worsen at all and what could I expect?  On the other hand if I seek treatment immediately will help in any way.  Hope to hear from you.  Thanks kindly [NAME]

query 3: "SUBJECT: Vamousse head lice treatment labe claims MESSAGE: To the best of my knowledge, any head lice treatment that claims to ""Kill"" lice and/or eggs is considered by FDA to be a drug claim and therefore needs to contain an FDA-registered pediculicide (kills lice) or an FDA-approved ovicide (kills eggs).  Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a ""new drug"" requiring appropriate testing.  The ""Vamousse"" head lice treatment claims ""Kills 100% lice and eggs"" and does not conform.  In addition, the claim ""kills 100%"" is in violation of FTC rulings which prohibit claiming ""100%"".  This company has also introduced a Head Lice Prevention product which is also in violation of FTC rulings (see FTC vs Lornamead).  I think that you should research these issues and publish your findings.  Thank you."
