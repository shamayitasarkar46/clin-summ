query 5: Hello. I have been a small eater my entire life, but always had difficulties eating. I’ve never looked at myself as having an eating disorder, but during the last year I came onto other thoughts when I went on a scale and saw a tiny bit of weight loss even when I felt I was eating more. That was earlier this year. For the last while I’ve had extremely difficulties eating. One meal a day is struggle enough. I want to gain weight and I want to eat. I’m a size 8, but sometimes even that is slightly big. I have never looked at myself as fat and always wanted to gain weight but never really had a desire to eat unless I’m super hungry or feel like I need to eat to avoid passing out. My stomach tells me to eat, but my brain informs me that I don’t need food and therefore I don’t eat. At my worst I feel nauseous just the tought of eating. I am super worried about this. Is there any vitamins or some sort of medication that can get me to eat even just a little bit more? Thanks.
