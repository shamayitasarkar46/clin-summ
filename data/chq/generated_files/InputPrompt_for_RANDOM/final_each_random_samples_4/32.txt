query 2: SUBJECT: other uses for Phentermine MESSAGE: Hello, My name is [NAME]. I do not usually send comments or questions online. I am only doing this because I am trying to find an answer to a baffling situation I am experiencing. I started taking Phentermine about 3 years ago for weight loss. I lost weight successfully, but also found that the Phentermine substantially relieved my arthritis pain. Now my doctor has taken me off of the Phentermine. He will not prescribe it for pain relief as he does not believe there is any correlation between the Phentermine and relief of my arthritis pain. I have taken many pain relief medications over the years as my arthritis is acute. The Phentermine works the best. Is there any correlation between Phentermine and pain relief?  Sincerely, [NAME]
