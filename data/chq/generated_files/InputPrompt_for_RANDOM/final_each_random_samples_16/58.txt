query 1: Hi All, I am from India and really worried. I have a 6 months old baby girl. I have read the article on Lactose intolerance. She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products. When she was a new born, I started giving her Lactogen (a formula milk) a little bit along with my milk. She was fine with it but after 3 weeks, I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year. She started drinking that along with my breast milk. After 2 weeks, she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day. Therefore, I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only. I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore, I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell. She was file with all the medicines. However, once the medicine stooped, she again started getting diarrhea. This continued on and off. After a while, the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her Zerolac (soy milk) along with breast feeding. I did that and everything smoothened. However, after 2 months, I asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as I was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk. The doctor asked me to give her formula milk (Nan Pro 0). I did that but just after half an hour, she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach. Once that stopped, she started getting diarrhea which continued till 3 days. She was put back on Zerolac again and breast milk. As she is now 6 months old, I thought of giving Cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again. I am unable to find the right doctor here in India where I live. Please help my daughter in this situation. Please let me know the contact detail may be an email address of any doctor with whom I can discuss my case. Please help us. Thanks for all your help. Regards, [cid:

query 17: Good morning, I'm not sure where to start with this so am hoping you could point me in the right direction please? My husband recently saw a specialist in relation to his elbow. He was told he would need an elbow reconstruction. The specialist mentioned that someone in the US had made something to fix this problem but even though it was patented, it didn't sell so it is now not made anymore. Would you know what this was and called, and who I could get in contact with about it please? We live in  Australia. My husband is a keen sportsman and is not taking this news very well as he's been told he won't be able to play sport again. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
