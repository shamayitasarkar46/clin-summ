query 15: SUBJECT: Mayonnaise and food poisoning MESSAGE: I have researched many other sites that say that mayonnaise is a safe food and that it is a myth that it causes food poisoning.  It seems to get a bad rap because it is used in combination with other items that cause food poisoning.  Some sites insist that it can even prevent the onslaught of bacterial growth, thus helping to ward off food poisoning because of its acidic nature.  Apparently it often used to be made at home, with eggs, and the eggs would go bad.....mayonnaise has thus carried this stigma ever since.  But many sites insist it is safe.  I was wondering what you think of these findings?   Thank you!
