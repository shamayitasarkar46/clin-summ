query 4: SUBJECT: Do Shrimp Allergies Subside Over Time MESSAGE: I used to eat shrimp all the time but suddenly developed an allergy to it when I turned 24. I went to an allergist and I definitely tested positive for shrimp allergy (all other shellfish like lobster, crab, etc. oddly was negative).  Are food allergies that develop later in life like this known to disappear over time? I'm just wondering if there's a safe way to test it if I'm too lazy/poor to go see an allergist again. It's been 8 years since I was diagnosed.  I'm not asking for a recommendation to my personal case but was just wondering the answer to my first question above.  Thanks

query 5: SUBJECT: ClinicalTrials.gov - Question - specific study MESSAGE: Are there any studies looking at familial/longetudnal fragile X or other related disorders? We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations (only 1 male in each), My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder as a child (at [LOCATION]) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and very similar intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations. What would be the best way to proceed?
