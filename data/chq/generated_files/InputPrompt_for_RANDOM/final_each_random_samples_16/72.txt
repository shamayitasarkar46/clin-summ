query 9: "SUBJECT: Vamousse head lice treatment labe claims MESSAGE: To the best of my knowledge, any head lice treatment that claims to ""Kill"" lice and/or eggs is considered by FDA to be a drug claim and therefore needs to contain an FDA-registered pediculicide (kills lice) or an FDA-approved ovicide (kills eggs).  Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a ""new drug"" requiring appropriate testing.  The ""Vamousse"" head lice treatment claims ""Kills 100% lice and eggs"" and does not conform.  In addition, the claim ""kills 100%"" is in violation of FTC rulings which prohibit claiming ""100%"".  This company has also introduced a Head Lice Prevention product which is also in violation of FTC rulings (see FTC vs Lornamead).  I think that you should research these issues and publish your findings.  Thank you."

query 13: SUBJECT: Rehabbing a finger that was splinted MESSAGE: I badlydislocated my finger 7 weeks ago.  I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?
