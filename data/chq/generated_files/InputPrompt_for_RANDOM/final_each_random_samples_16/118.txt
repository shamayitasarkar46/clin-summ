query 14: "SUBJECT: Vamousse head lice treatment labe claims MESSAGE: To the best of my knowledge, any head lice treatment that claims to ""Kill"" lice and/or eggs is considered by FDA to be a drug claim and therefore needs to contain an FDA-registered pediculicide (kills lice) or an FDA-approved ovicide (kills eggs).  Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a ""new drug"" requiring appropriate testing.  The ""Vamousse"" head lice treatment claims ""Kills 100% lice and eggs"" and does not conform.  In addition, the claim ""kills 100%"" is in violation of FTC rulings which prohibit claiming ""100%"".  This company has also introduced a Head Lice Prevention product which is also in violation of FTC rulings (see FTC vs Lornamead).  I think that you should research these issues and publish your findings.  Thank you."
