query 6: SUBJECT: Do Shrimp Allergies Subside Over Time MESSAGE: I used to eat shrimp all the time but suddenly developed an allergy to it when I turned 24. I went to an allergist and I definitely tested positive for shrimp allergy (all other shellfish like lobster, crab, etc. oddly was negative).  Are food allergies that develop later in life like this known to disappear over time? I'm just wondering if there's a safe way to test it if I'm too lazy/poor to go see an allergist again. It's been 8 years since I was diagnosed.  I'm not asking for a recommendation to my personal case but was just wondering the answer to my first question above.  Thanks
