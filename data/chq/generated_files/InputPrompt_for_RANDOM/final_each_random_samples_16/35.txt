query 3: Thank you for your response to my inquiry about the MMR vaccine.  I was born in 1942, never had the 10-day measles but did have the 3-day measles, and did have mumps as a child.  A recent blood test indicated that I am not immune to Rubella so my doctor recommended I get the MMR vaccine.  In light of my age, etc., do you agree or do you feel it is unnecessary or is there a separate vaccine for just Rubella?  Which is the measles that has started to reappear?

query 4: Hi All, I am from India and really worried. I have a 6 months old baby girl. I have read the article on Lactose intolerance. She is unable to digest any formula milk or any milk products. When she was a new born, I started giving her Lactogen (a formula milk) a little bit along with my milk. She was fine with it but after 3 weeks, I switched her to another formula milk named Nan Pro 0 which is for babies upto 1 year. She started drinking that along with my breast milk. After 2 weeks, she started getting Diarrhea and a severe one where she pooped at least 15 times in one day. Therefore, I consulted the doctor and the doctor immediately asked me to put her on breast milk only. I did try that but she was hungry and crying therefore, I gave her a little bit of formula milk aswell. She was file with all the medicines. However, once the medicine stooped, she again started getting diarrhea. This continued on and off. After a while, the doctor asked me to stop the formula milk and start giving her Zerolac (soy milk) along with breast feeding. I did that and everything smoothened. However, after 2 months, I asked my doctor if we can start giving her any type of milk apart from zerolac as I was concerned about her getting calcium in her body with having milk. The doctor asked me to give her formula milk (Nan Pro 0). I did that but just after half an hour, she suddenly started vomiting which continued till she had the milk in her stomach. Once that stopped, she started getting diarrhea which continued till 3 days. She was put back on Zerolac again and breast milk. As she is now 6 months old, I thought of giving Cerelac to her but again she did not digest it and went through the same problem again. I am unable to find the right doctor here in India where I live. Please help my daughter in this situation. Please let me know the contact detail may be an email address of any doctor with whom I can discuss my case. Please help us. Thanks for all your help. Regards, [cid:
