query 4: SUBJECT: CPTII Deficiency MESSAGE: My sister in Texas was just diagnosed with CPTII deficiency today.  We do not yet know which variant.  I was told a year ago following her near death from rhabdo (CK's 150,000+), ATN, RF, respiratory compromise, to be tested for a FA metabolic error.  Until today, I really had no idea which test to request.  Her muscle bx was performed a few months ago as she was still ill last year.  Another recurrence of rhado this year prompted the bx (she is retired military).  I don't know which branch of medicine to contact for genetic testing. From  the NIH website, muscle bx is the most definitive.  I also found a phone number for the Genetics and Rare Diseases Information Center.  Thank you for some direction.

query 5: SUBJECT: Mayonnaise and food poisoning MESSAGE: I have researched many other sites that say that mayonnaise is a safe food and that it is a myth that it causes food poisoning.  It seems to get a bad rap because it is used in combination with other items that cause food poisoning.  Some sites insist that it can even prevent the onslaught of bacterial growth, thus helping to ward off food poisoning because of its acidic nature.  Apparently it often used to be made at home, with eggs, and the eggs would go bad.....mayonnaise has thus carried this stigma ever since.  But many sites insist it is safe.  I was wondering what you think of these findings?   Thank you!

query 8: SUBJECT: uncontrollable jerking movements MESSAGE: When I am exercising hard, the left side of my body will start to do strange things. When lifting weights overhead, my left upper lift will jerk up into sort of a sneer.  When doing core work, my left arm will start jerking so hard that it's impossible to hold onto anything. The jerking stops after the exercise ends; but my left arm feels worn out.  No pain. A few months ago, my left leg completely lost any strength for weeks. It first appeared when I was just trying to do a squat with a plastic pipe in my hand. Eventually was able to work strength back. Again - no pain.  Should I be alarmed?

query 12: SUBJECT: concussions and long term head trauma  from abuse Ii MESSAGE: I was a victim from an abusive relationship, both verbal and physical. During this time I received substantial injuries to my head. Slight concussions led to full-fledged concussions, losing the ability to talk very well, then think very well, and a subdural hematoma, on the left side, bled down inside my head to behind my left eye, which made it unable to move. Along with an intense headache and drinking a lot of coffee, the neurosurgeon didn't have to do brain surgery,  as my eye finally moved!Battered Women's told me to get out of the area a stay gone if I wanted to stay alive. So I did! Speech Therapy helped considerably, the story goes on.  Anyway, I hear and read a lot about concussions and head trauma for football players,  young and old,  and wonder if any studies have ever been done for women?   A few years ago,  I had a partial stroke,  but enough to set me back a bit.  But this time I know what I need to do to help fix my head,  again.
