I wake frequently during the night and my brain seems to engage in much thought, making it difficult to go back to sleep. I wake well before the 5:45 alarm and drag myself out of bed. I am exhausted all day and can fall asleep at day or evening events I have seen endocrinologists, in addition to my GYN and primary care dr., all of whom tell me all my blood tests are normal. I take 2 sport yoga classes and a Qi Gong class weekly. I was a young 65, but at 66, the lack of sleep has finally caught up with me and I feel much older than my 66 years.
