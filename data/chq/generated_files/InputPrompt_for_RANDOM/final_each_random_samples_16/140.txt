query 13: SUBJECT: Rehabbing a finger that was splinted MESSAGE: I badlydislocated my finger 7 weeks ago.  I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?

query 15: SUBJECT: affects from being molested MESSAGE: I was molested by my father when I was a child (over 45 years ago).  I've been working on recovery the past couple of years (the memories surfaced in 2010).  As part of my recovery, I'm exploring how being sodomized by my father may have damaged my rectum and surrounding areas.    What kinds of physical damage would have been done by a 22 year old male sodomizing a 5 year old boy?    I'm looking to see if that caused tears in the rectum that would have lead to having to have 9 surgeries as an adult to repair them.  I don't think they just happened.  thanks in advance.
