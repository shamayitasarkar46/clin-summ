She developed on our own, got her period on her own, she is now pregnant on her own with identical twins. My question is can she have normal children or do they have more of a chance of having Turner syndrome.  My daughter has been tested many times to confirm her diagnosis of Turner syndrome and she is a full XO not mosaic but still does not display many of the characteristics. Again, I am just questioning the safety of the pregnancy and the health of the babies. Thank you for your help", "target": "What is the inheritance pattern of Turner syndrome?"}}

If not, then are there any drugs that your studies have shown to be superior to Ketoconazole?  If so, will you please list up to 3 of them for me? 3. My Dermatologist suggested that I use Zeasorb antifungal powder.  Have you ever conducted a study of this?
