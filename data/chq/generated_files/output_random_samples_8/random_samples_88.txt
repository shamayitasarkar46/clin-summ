I take Levothyroxin 137mg dailey for my thyroid condition.  I take no other meds on a regular basis except for the normal pain meds prescribed during my recovery. During my recovery, I never felt comfortable and free of pain. I finally asked for a blood test and discovered my TSH level at 31.13.  My question is, will a high TSH level interfere with healing and recovery of muscle tissue and bones?  I am now taking a higher dose of Levthyroxin, can I expect a longer than normal recovery period due to a high TSH level?

We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations (only 1 male in each), My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder as a child (at [LOCATION]) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and very similar intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations.
