Would it be advisable to avoid pregnancy? Please know that we have always talked about adoption, so it is not the end of the world if I can't have my own kids.Also, I was told that my adhesions were caused by an appendectomy (appendix had not ruptured) I had in 2004, but as it was all keyhole surgery, I don't understand why? Please note that they also removed a small cist from both the ovaries and bowel at the the same time. I am prone to small ovarian cists that come and go on their own (most of the time).Can you help with my questions?Many Thanks for any information you have,Kind Regards,[NAME]", "target": "Can abdominal adhesions or  a neurostimulation device affect pregnancy?"}}
