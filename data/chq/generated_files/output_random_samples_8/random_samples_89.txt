I've been working on recovery the past couple of years (the memories surfaced in 2010).  As part of my recovery, I'm exploring how being sodomized by my father may have damaged my rectum and surrounding areas.    What kinds of physical damage would have been done by a 22 year old male sodomizing a 5 year old boy?    I'm looking to see if that caused tears in the rectum that would have lead to having to have 9 surgeries as an adult to repair them.

Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a \"\"new drug\"\" requiring appropriate testing.  The \"\"Vamousse\"\" head lice treatment claims \"\"Kills 100% lice and eggs\"\" and does not conform.  In addition, the claim \"\"kills 100%\"\" is in violation of FTC rulings which prohibit claiming \"\"100%\"\".  This company has also introduced a Head Lice Prevention product which is also in violation of FTC rulings (see FTC vs Lornamead).
