MESSAGE: Hello my name is  [NAME]  and I am a 32  yr old female that has sever problems with abdominal adhesions. I have had several surgeries do to pain and complications. Now I have been vomiting for a year now everytime I eat. I have had several tests done. Nothing obvious shows which leads the dr in Springfield Illinois to believe it's scar tissue pushing on my stomach wall and causing me to expel my food within 30 min of eating. I started out at over 235 pounds and am bouncing around 150-170 now.  I am in severe pain. I am tired of living off pain medicine. I need help!!!!! Please please please!!!! It all started when I had c-section for [PHI] in 2003. I have had to have per 6 abd surgeries since with the last one in 20012 total hystorectomy .   I did well for about a year. And now back to square one just with new problems. I do not want to have surgery to just remove the tissue again. Although it will give me great relief it will cause more. I need something to help inhibit the growth of tissue.  Can anyone help me?? I am very desperate!! I am tired of not being there for [PHI]. In so much pain!! Pain meds are hit and miss on helping and I just hate taking them. I am looking into  essential oils to help with my symptoms. It is a living hell!

We are 4 generations of a family with similar traits in the males in each of those generations (only 1 male in each), My dad is 92 (still healthy, sharp as always but always suffered from functional disabilities) and the youngest is 2 1/2, with very significant developmental delays. My son (his father, aged 30) was diagnosed with ADD and central auditory processing disorder as a child (at [LOCATION]) but I am now sure he has fragile x (facial features, low IQ, math inability, etc). In my generation, there is one male, my half-brother, who also has ADD (w/o hyperactivity) and very similar intellectual deficits. I know fragile X does not pass through father to son; is there any other explanation? We have not had genetic testing, but think there might be some clinical benefit to researching our family genes for understanding of the links between these 4 males, 4 generations. What would be the best way to proceed?", "target": "Where can I find information on Fragile X sydrome and inheritance patterns?"}}

My son 28 and myself 56 have this problem and we both have systemic muscle spasms. cramps contractions. Most seem to be caused by knots or trigger points. I assume this has something to do with this deficiency because it deals with neuro transmissions correct. Anyway we are looking for relief. The muscle relaxants help a bit but the knots do not go away and so the pain is still there at a deeper level. The doctors and neurologist have no idea. Thank you.

As prescribed started with the 1/2 dose, and immediately had the flushing, swelling of my lips and nose. I called my Dr. he said it's not uncommon take an aspirin with every dose. I did, and  it seemed to lessen. I started the full dose. Everyday I took the pill, my pain increased! After a few weeks, the pain I usually had in flair ups, had now multiplied to an intolerable level! I stopped the Tecfedra. Unfortunately the pain did not! Until today, my pain level is at it maximum. Nothing I've taken such as Percocet, oxycodone etc. will not relieve it!! I've also since developed frequent  sweating and cellulitis on my left thigh and abdomen! Has anyone else had these problems? PLEASE! If so, tell me what they did to stop them!
