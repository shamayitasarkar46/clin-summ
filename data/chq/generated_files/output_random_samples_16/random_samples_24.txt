Until today, I really had no idea which test to request.  Her muscle bx was performed a few months ago as she was still ill last year.  Another recurrence of rhado this year prompted the bx (she is retired military).  I don't know which branch of medicine to contact for genetic testing. From  the NIH website, muscle bx is the most definitive.  I also found a phone number for the Genetics and Rare Diseases Information Center.

It seems to get a bad rap because it is used in combination with other items that cause food poisoning.  Some sites insist that it can even prevent the onslaught of bacterial growth, thus helping to ward off food poisoning because of its acidic nature.  Apparently it often used to be made at home, with eggs, and the eggs would go bad.....mayonnaise has thus carried this stigma ever since.  But many sites insist it is safe.

Along with an intense headache and drinking a lot of coffee, the neurosurgeon didn't have to do brain surgery,  as my eye finally moved!Battered Women's told me to get out of the area a stay gone if I wanted to stay alive. So I did! Speech Therapy helped considerably, the story goes on.  Anyway, I hear and read a lot about concussions and head trauma for football players,  young and old,  and wonder if any studies have ever been done for women?
