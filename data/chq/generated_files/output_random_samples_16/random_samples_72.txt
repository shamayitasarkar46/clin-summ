Now I have been vomiting for a year now everytime I eat. I have had several tests done. Nothing obvious shows which leads the dr in Springfield Illinois to believe it's scar tissue pushing on my stomach wall and causing me to expel my food within 30 min of eating. I started out at over 235 pounds and am bouncing around 150-170 now.  I am in severe pain. I am tired of living off pain medicine. I need help!!!!! Please please please!!!! It all started when I had c-section for [PHI] in 2003. I have had to have per 6 abd surgeries since with the last one in 20012 total hystorectomy .   I did well for about a year. And now back to square one just with new problems. I do not want to have surgery to just remove the tissue again. Although it will give me great relief it will cause more. I need something to help inhibit the growth of tissue.  Can anyone help me?? I am very desperate!! I am tired of not being there for [PHI]. In so much pain!! Pain meds are hit and miss on helping and I just hate taking them. I am looking into  essential oils to help with my symptoms. It is a living hell!

Otherwise the product is considered to be misbranded and a \"\"new drug\"\" requiring appropriate testing.  The \"\"Vamousse\"\" head lice treatment claims \"\"Kills 100% lice and eggs\"\" and does not conform.  In addition, the claim \"\"kills 100%\"\" is in violation of FTC rulings which prohibit claiming \"\"100%\"\".  This company has also introduced a Head Lice Prevention product which is also in violation of FTC rulings (see FTC vs Lornamead).

I reset it myself as it happened late in the evening. I splinted it myself with a store-bought splint because of concern for a break as well as ligament damage.  I just went to see an orthopedic doctor for the first time today (yes, I'm kicking myself for not going earlier).  The X-ray showed that the finger is still offset somewhat, perhaps indicating that some of the ligaments were ruptured. (The bone was ok.  I guess we won't know if it was ever broken.)  Nonetheless, I have to see a surgeon for an opinion in a few days.  Meanwhile, there is still some swelling and the ring finger that was in the splint is out but stiff as a board.  I'm concerned and not sure what possibilities to expect.  I certainly know you won't know what the situation is or what the surgeon will say but I was curious (a) what possibilities I might expect and (b) how problematic it is that the finger is so stiff...should I expect to regain motion...can it be rehabbed?  I'm assuming so, and if so, how long does it take to regain motion from a finger that has been splinted for so long?", "target": "What are the treatments and prognosis for a dislocated finger not initially treated?"}}
