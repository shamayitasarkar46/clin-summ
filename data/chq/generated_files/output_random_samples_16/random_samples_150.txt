I am looking forward to answer, anxious and carefully.   [NAME] CRM88878  I just can not understand the difficulty in finding a laboratory or institution that can solve this problem as the peritoneal layer of the bladder peritoneum is I already own, the inner layer is smooth muscle, which can also be acquired via endoscopic biopsy of the stomach or a arterial tissue and the layer It is coated internally by internal polymorph or transitional epithelium which can be acquired from another organ.
