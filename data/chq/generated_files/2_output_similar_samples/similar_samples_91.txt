MESSAGE: Hi, I am writing because I have been diagnosed with depression and have been treated with several different medications because of a serious side effect I get with sertraline.  They have given me a small dosage, 25mg a day,  I have tried with Celexa, Prestiq, Paxil, Cymbalta and they all make my legs shaky.  I get weak in my legs and I get a tingling sensation.  My legs hurt and get a tingling sensastion.    Why do I get this side effect?  Is there something else I can take??  I was also wondering if it has to do with any other medications that I take.  Sometimes I take dormicum for sleeping problems and Lorazepan.    Eagerly waiting for your comments", "target": "What antidepressants are not likely to interact with lorazepam and cause weakness and tingling in my legs?"}}

I also take anxiety meds and an anti-seizure medication. Lately my life has been spinning out of control and I'm so scared. I can't seem to find the right doctor and I need someone to speak to NOT JUST GIVE ME MEDICATIONS! I need help and if I do not get help soon I'm afraid for myself. I have no intentions on hurting or harming myself but I'm a mess. I need a doctor who can help me in both ways (talking & medication). I just want to go away, move far away! What would you suggest? What type of doctor should I be looking for? I'm desperate!", "target": "How can I get non-drug treatment for depression and anxiety?"}}
{"type": "TRAIN_ENTRY", "data": {"idx": 119, "inputs": "Okay, so for about a year or two I've had chronic depression, insomnia, migraines, mistaking stomache problems as something worse, and having issues focusing on many of things. At first i thought i had ADD because ive never been tested for it, and because im young and dumb i took 2 pills of aderol because i was having very bad issues focusing. It worked and i was able to focus way better, but seeing all of these symptoms makes me think its not ADD. I'm only 16 years old, and I've just started getting tired of going through this every day of my life! So based on on all of this information I've provided you, do you believe that I may have GAD and should talk fo my doctor, or does it sound like something different?", "target": "What are the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and when should I contact my doctor to discuss my symptoms?"}}
