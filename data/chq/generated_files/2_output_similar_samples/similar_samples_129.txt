He suggested me some pain killers and advised me to wear anklet. I have been following the instruction since then; I went to another doctor who advised me to go for physiotherapy (Short Wave Diathermy) and advised me some exercises. I have been following them too.

Can you please suggest me how to overcome the pain. Thanks.", "target": "What are the treatments for ankle injury and pain? "}}
