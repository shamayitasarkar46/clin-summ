I truly wish to be a part of your research if need be because the disorder had greatly affected my life. If you already have medical drugs to cure and restore my smell sense kindly give information on how I can acquire to benefit from this. I pray that God the Creator gracefully grants me favour with this so that I can enjoy the beauty of His creation in this world, with respect to smell, before I depart to continue with Him in heaven. Cheers for now as I wait to hear from you. [NAME], Ms. Smell disorder (anosmia) patient /sufferer, writing from [LOCATION].
