It began with pain, swelling and stiffness in my feet and  toes.A lot of the pain is joint stiff n ess and my skin feels like its being burned. Over time it has moved into my knees also. I am always tired. Recently I've been getting pains in my stomache and feeling sick. Does any of this sound like Lupus?? I've tested negative for it before, but the more I read about it I feel that's what i could have. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.", "target": "What are the symptoms of lupus?"}}

In the months following i had 2 decompression surgeries. the 1st one didnt work, was pain free for about 90 days.  The second syrgery 6 months later left me with a numb face but no tri gemn pain. Could the tri gem have been brought on from the trauma to the head from the car accident? I had been diagosed prior to  the accident, but was not experiencing any symptoms for a long time.  Then the accident and  1 1 /2 days later im in a full blown episode. Please let me know what your thoughts are.", "target": "Can symptoms of trigeminal neuralgia be exacerbated by head trauma?"}}
