My son (dob-[DATE]), was called back to the hospital four days after birth due to a abnormal PKU, which suggested adrenal hyperplasia.

His urine (24 hr), blood plasma,& VMA,showed increased values of catacholomines.He also demostrated intermittent hypertension, and tachcardia through out the day (he had been diagnoised with ADHD several years earlier). His MIGB clearly showed bifocal uptake in both adrenal glands. The mri did not show tumors at that time ([DATE].

His symptons that I have not already include heat intolerence, pallor, poor appetite with little weight gain, anxiety, tremor of hands, and stomach pain. After his mri, which I was told would take about 45mins, took over 5 hrs. Since then we have been having no luck with finding doctors that will take my son as a patient. Are you able to suggest a hospital that is knowlegable with pheochromocytomas? My son's father is mia, but during our 7 yrs together,  he also suffered severe headaches, and intermittent hypertension. He never followed up with a physian. Any help would be appreciated. I do not know what to do, and I do not want my son to end up a statistic.  Last night his BB was 180/115, with HR-50, half hour later his BP was 68/44 with HR of 122. I fear he is going to go in shoc", "target": "How can I find physician(s) or hospital(s) who specialize in pheochromocytomas?"}}
