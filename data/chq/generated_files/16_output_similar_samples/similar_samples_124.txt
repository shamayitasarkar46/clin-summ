The Dr wanted to prescribe a pill to stop the leaking but I waited until I went back  for my one month check up, all the while leaking just as bad as I did before the surgery.  When she examined me she said the bladder had slipped out of the sling and we would have to do the surgery again this time she would suture it to the ligament behind the pelvic bone.   My question is this:  #1. why would it slip?  was she supposed to suture it before to prevent the slipping? what guarantees that it won't slip again?  I am very concerned about having to go under anesthesia again and certainly do not want to risk having to go yet a 3rd time to solve my stress incontinence issues.

Would it be advisable to avoid pregnancy? Please know that we have always talked about adoption, so it is not the end of the world if I can't have my own kids.Also, I was told that my adhesions were caused by an appendectomy (appendix had not ruptured) I had in 2004, but as it was all keyhole surgery, I don't understand why? Please note that they also removed a small cist from both the ovaries and bowel at the the same time. I am prone to small ovarian cists that come and go on their own (most of the time).Can you help with my questions?Many Thanks for any information you have,Kind Regards,[NAME]", "target": "Can abdominal adhesions or  a neurostimulation device affect pregnancy?"}}
